The\n        basic physics of the green house effect were figured out more than a hundred years ago by a smart guy using only pen and pencil. Solar radiation passes\n        through the atmosphere to the surface of earth where it is absorbed and radiated upward as heat. Global warming is primarily a problem of too much carbon\n        dioxide in the atmosphere which acts a blanket, trapping heat and warming the planet. As we burn fossil fuels like coal, oil and natural gas for energy and cut\n        down to create pastures and plantations. Global warming is the increase of earth average surface temperature due to effect of green house gases such as\n        carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuel or from deforestation which trap heat that would otherwise escape from earth. Energy from sun drives the\n        earth weather and climate. The earth radiates energy back into space. Some atmospheric gases trap some of the outgoing energy. The green house effect is\n        the rise in temperature on earth as certain gases in the atmosphere trap energy. Water pollution is the contamination of water bodies. This form of\n        environmental degradation occurs when pollutants are directly or indirectly discharged into water bodies without adequate treatment to remove harmful\n        compounds. Air pollution is the introduction of particulates, biological molecules and other harmful materials into earth atmosphere. Smog hanging over\n        cities is the most familiar and obvious form of air pollution. People introduce into the atmosphere that has damaging effects on living things and the\n        environment is considered as air pollution.', "\n        The rise in earth's surface temperature as a consequence of green house effect is called global warming. The thickening of earth atmosphere because of\n        presence of increased carbon dioxide and other gases is called greenhouse effect. Deforestation and industrial emissions result to an increase greenhouse\n        gases around earth's atmosphere. These greenhouse gases traps and absorbs atmospheric heat and ultimately causes global warming. Global warming is\n        causing climate change. The globe is becoming warmer and warmer. One major consequence of global warming arising out of greenhouse effect is the rise in\n        sea level. Although the changes in sea level have received much publicity, problems of water availability are likely to be more serious and perhaps more\n        expensive to solve. The human health is put at risk because of global warming. To prevent global warming, the laws that govern pollution and greenhouse\n        gases should be followed. Reduced dependence on thermal power for our electricity need help towards reducing the quantity of carbon dioxide in the\n        environment. The use of fossil fuels for generating conventional energy is a nature of greenhouse gases. We can save paper by keeping documents in\n        electronic formats and by not printing. Trees absorbs carbon dioxide and releases oxygen. Trees are helpful in reducing the problem of global warming.\n        Global warming has become a big issue which need to be solved permanently. Rise in carbon dioxide level on the earth impacts the human life to great level\n        through continued heat waves, unpredictable and unexpected cyclone, lack of food, diseases, death etc. In order to stop the life threatening effects the global\n        warming, we should take a permanent break from all the bad habits causing increase in the carbon dioxide level. We should stop deforestation, lessen the use\n        of electricity, stop the burning of wood etc. Global warming leads to acid rains which effects the people very badly.", "\n        Global warming is the term to describe a gradual increase in the average temperature of Earth's atmosphere. A change that is believed to be permanently\n        changing the Earth's climate. There is great debate among many people, and sometimes in the news, on whether global warming is real. However scientist's\n        looking at the data and facts agree the planet is warming. The increased volume of carbon dioxide and other green house gases released by burning of fossil\n        fuels, land clearing , agriculture, and other human activities are to be believed primary cause for warming the earth's temperature. Scientist's from the\n        Intergovernmental panel on Climate carrying out global warming research have recently predicted that average global temperatures could increase between\n        one to five by the year. Changes resulting the global warming may include rising sea levels due to melting of the polar ice caps, as well as an increase in the\n        occurrence and severity of storms. The severe weather events results in increasing the temperature of the earth. Global warming is primarily of too much\n        carbon dioxide in the atmosphere Local sources of carbon emissions vary from region to region, suggesting that solutions are often decided at the\n        community level. The climate of hot map points to regional examples of climate friendly energy, transportation or adaption choices. Some regions must rely\n        upon global solutions such as international agreements to reduce the carbon over loading the atmosphere that threatens them. Small islands are polluting\n        sources of carbon emission and affected by the consequence of global carbon over load as accelerated the sea level rise threatens the very existence of low\n        lying islands.\n        In my point of view, global warming can be decreased by reducing the cutting of trees. However global warming is a cause for many dangerous situations.\n        Global warming threatens the human life.", '\n        One of the biggest problems facing the world today is global warming. Many scientists believe that our production of carbon dioxide and other green house\n        gases are the major effects causing to the atmosphere and this could be very dangerous for human life.\n        There are several issues which causing global warming are increasing vehicles and due to this carbon dioxide is getting increased and the atmosphere is being\n        polluted. This vehicles will cause very bad effects on the environment by increasing pollution and making surrounding get polluted. This will effects the ozone\n        layer and results in uneven seasons because of the damage of ozone layer. Carbon dioxide which are coming from vehicles causes many effects to ozone layer\n        and the atmosphere. Global warming is also because of deforestation and this deforestation results in decrease of trees and making the production of oxygen\n        less. This is the reason because earth is heating too much as the trees are decreasing it means deforestation increasing the oxygen levels are decreasing when\n        compared to carbon dioxide levels. Carbon dioxide, which damages the ozone layer, comes from several sources, but the most problematic are those coming\n        from burning of fossil fuels from power plants. This releases thousands of tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere every year. This is also because of\n        emission of burning of gasoline for transportation, which continuous to increase because of our demand of cars and also our increasing worldwide\n        consumption, resulting in an increasing need of transportation. These all are increasing global warming a\n        To conclude, although global warming is a serious issue, there are steps that government and individuals can take care to reduce its effects. If we are to save\n        our planet, it is important that this is treated as a priority for all concerned.', '\n        Global warming is the term used to describe a gradual increase in the average temperature of the earths atmosphere and its oceans, a change that is believed\n        permanently changing the earths climate.

Global\n        warming is primarily a problem of too much carbon dioxide in the atmosphere which acts as a blanket, trapping heat and warming the planet. As we burn\n        fossil fuels like coal, oil and natural gas for energy or cut down and burn forests to create pastures and plantations. Carbon accumulates and overloads our\n        atmosphere. Certain waste management and agricultural practices aggravate the problem by releasing other potent global warming gases.\n        Global warming causes our earth more affect. Global warming is already having significant and harmful effect on our communities, our health and our climate.\n        We must take immediate action to address global warming or these consequences will continue to intensify, grow ever more costly, and increasingly affect\n        the entire planet including you also.\n        Global warming is causing mainly by deforestation and burning fossil fuels. By deforesting the forests the carbon dioxide in the air increases. Mainly the plants\n        take carbon dioxide and leaves oxygen which is more helpful for human beings for leaving on the earth. If we cutting the forests the carbon dioxide increases\n        in the earth and oxygen content is becoming less. By burning the fossil fuels the air is polluted. The impact of global warming are accelerating sea level rise,\n        longer and more damaging wild fire seasons, more frequent and intense heat waves, costly and growing health impacts and leaves precipitation and flooding.\n        The solution of global warming are reduce emissions, stop deforestation, fight misinformation and prepare for impacts.', "\n        Global warming is the effect to cause in spoiling the harmful nature. One of the biggest problems facing the world today is global warming. Many scientists\n        believe that our production of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases is having a heat effect on the atmosphere, and this could be very dangerous to\n        human life. Global warming is a big environmental and social issues all over the world which everyone know especially to the kids and children as they are the\n        future. Our earth's atmosphere become hot day by day by trapping the sun's heat and rise in the level of atmospheric carbon dioxide. The bad day of it\n        increasing day by day and causing major problems to the living of human beings. Rise in the carbon dioxide level is the use of fossil fuels like cut down of the\n        plants by the human being on earth. Decreasing number of plants on earth increases the level of carbon dioxide, as plants are main source of the using\n        carbon dioxide released by the human being. Global warming has the most worrying threat for the earth's atmosphere as it reduces the life possibility on the\n        earth day by day through a continuous process. Before planning of the solution we must think about the causes and effects of it on the atmosphere. Global\n        warming threats effects are increasing day by day and creating danger for human life. Global warming is the main and only reason for raising the sea level,\n        flooding, changes in the weather patterns, lack to food, death etc. The only solution to solve the issue of the global warming is the individual level of social\n        awareness. People should stop by producing carbon dioxide just stopping their bad habits such as stop the use of cutting plants to absorb carbon dioxide and\n        produce oxygen.", '\n        Today our topic is Is global warming a cause for concern ? Yes of course, Global warming is a concern in this modern world. The global warming is one of the\n        most concerns in the modern world. Global warming is caused when the temperature from sun reaches earth, it absorbs the heat and releases the excess heat\n        into the atmosphere. The Green house gases present in the Atmosphere acts like a blanket and does not allow the heat to enter into the outer atmosphere\n        and therefore, increasing the Atmospheric temperature. The green house gases are Carbon dioxide, Ozone, Methane, Carbon monoxide and some other.\n        Global warming is also caused by Human activities like industrialization, vehicles and some other. The Greenhouse gases are mainly released from industries,\n        vehicles, refrigerators, Burning of fossil fuels and some other. The effects of Global warming are Rapid climate change, health problems in humans, reduction\n        of oxygen in atmosphere, increase of temperatures of Sea water, melting of Polar ice caps, increase in level of Ocean water and some other. In this fast\n        developing world of course, industrialization is very important also they should focus on plantations around their industries. The Inter Governmental panel on\n        climate change has reported in 2004 that over 95% of climate change is responsible for Global warming. Government should start awareness programs\n        among people on Global warming and the effects caused by it. In our country Government ordered the industries to maintain greenery inside and around the\n        industry. People should also be responsible, and plant as many as trees as possible and increasing the oxygen in the Atmosphere. Global warming can only be\n        reduced by plantation, thus making the life prosper in this world.', "\n        The raise of earth's atmosphere causes, and lead to the green house effect. This effect is known as global warming. The harmful gases like carbon dioxide and\n        emissions from industries causes green house effect. Due to increase in population there is a dramatic changes in the atmosphere, because they need shelter,\n        food due to this reasons they are cutting the forests. Deforestation leads to changes in the atmosphere, because they can balance the climatic condition by\n        observing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen. The harmful gases like carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and by using coolers may form thick gases layers,\n        and they made the earth's atmosphere heat by sending back the waves to the earth surface, this causes global warming. From all these reasons the icebergs in\n        the Polar region melts, and the areas near to the sea regions are submerged by increase in the water level in the oceans. However, most of the cities are\n        located at the edge of the seas and in the future they may immersed in the bottom of the sea. It can be controlled by afforestation by planting the trees, and\n        maintain ecological balance in the atmosphere. Today the population is increasing rapidly, and they are using their own transportation, but if we share the\n        transportation among our relatives we can control the pollution. Nowadays, the abnormal climatic changes can be noticed clearly, because of deforestation,\n        booming of population. Green houses like carbon, methane are the main causes of global warming, that should be taken care. Increasing global worming lead\n        to the more water evaporated from the earth into the atmosphere. So, we should concern all these effects and eri", '\n        The topic is whether global warming is a cause for concern or not. Yes, the problem of global warming is a difficult situation we are facing because of human\n        development. Humans are developing by introducing some unnatural things into the environment and those are not able to adjust in nature because they are\n        not part of it. Those are turning into harmful and making our own earth, a dangerous planet thereby damaging it. However, this problem is known by\n        everyone and no one cares because humans are eccentric beings. We want water, fresh air, nature, rains, waterfalls, beaches, wind and we do not want to\n        protect them because when ever there is a need of preservation, the thing becomes public. The thing becomes public means the thing should be done by\n        Government, but we can spoil them individually. Global warming is bane and there is no question in calling it boon because it is causing great damage to\n        earth. Ozone layer is damaging and thereby allowing dangerous ultraviolet rays to fall on earth, this is called global warming. Living beings can not tolerate\n        when this rays fall on them. Subsequently, the water level is increasing because of melting ice bergs in oceans. This increased water level is swallowing the\n        land area and if it continues, there will be no land on this planet. The remedy for this hazard is tedious and tiresome process because the time to make this\n        control is over and now it is the time to face the consequences. Fortunately, if we start the process of preserving resources of earth, stopping deforestation,\n        starting afforestation, restricting the constructions, controlling the pollution, we can definitely secure our planet. Every home should contain minimum number\n        of plants and even ornamental plants can help us. So, planting the trees is the only remedy to secure the environment and prevent global warming.', "\n        Global warming is continuous heating from the earth's surface. It causes warming the environment by increasing the level of carbon dioxide gas in the\n        environment. Global warming has become a big issue which need to be solved by the positive way in all country.As gradual increase in the temperature calls\n        various threats as well as makes in the country. Rise in carbon dioxide level in the earth impacts the human life to great level to continued heat waves, sudden\n        occurrence of storms, and predictable and unexpected cyclone, damage to ozone layer, floods, heavy rain, drought, lack of food, disease, death. It has been\n        researched that increasing emissions of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is because of non stop of burning fossil fuels, usage of fertilizer, cutting forest,\n        gases used in refrigerator. The increasing level of carbon dioxide causes green house effect on the earth in which all the green house gases absorbs thermal\n        radiation. The temperature of earth surface and leads to global warming. In order to stop the life threatening effects of global warming, we should take\n        permanent break from all the bad habits causing in these carbon dioxide level and other green house gases leading to the green house effect and then earth\n        surface warming. We should stop deforestation, lessen the use of electricity, stop the burning of wood. Controlling the population growth is also a great hand\n        towards reducing the global warming all through the world through prevent from the global warming . The people is to plant the green plants in their\n        environment.", "\n        Today our topic is about global warming. Global warming is the main cause of all effects in the environment.

Our earth becoming hot day by day\n        trapping the sun's heat rise the level of atmospheric carbon dioxide. The main cause of global warming is deforestation and carbon dioxide. The bad effects\n        increasing day by day and causing major problems to the living beings. The continuous increase of carbon dioxide cause green house effect. Although the\n        increase of near surface atmospheric temperature is the measure of global warming often reported in popular areas, most of the energy stored in the climate\n        as gone into the oceans. The rest has melted ice and warmed the continents and atmosphere. Future climate change and associated impacts will differ from\n        region to region around the globe. Anticipated effects include warming global temperature, rising sea levels, changing precipitation and expansion of deserts.\n        Warming is expected to be greater over land than over the oceans and with the continuing retreat of droughts, heavy rainfall with floods and heavy snowfall.\n        Effects significant to humans include the threat to food security from decreasing crop yields and the abandonment of populated areas due to rising sea levels.\n        Public reactions to global warming and concern about its effects are also increasing. The green house effect is the process in which the absorption and\n        emission of infrared radiation by gases in a planet's atmosphere warm its lower atmosphere and surface. On Earth, naturally occurring amounts of green\n        house gases cause air temperature to increase. The major green house gases are carbon dioxide and ozone. Clouds are also affected due to global warming.\n        Humans must follow some precautions to decrease the level of carbon dioxide.", "\n        Yes, global warming is definitely a cause for concern. Global warming is one of the biggest problems people are facing in present days. Global warming means\n        rise in the temperature of earth due to carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. If they are released into atmosphere in large quantities, temperature of\n        the earth will rise rapidly. Global warming results in melting of ice in the polar regions which will result in increase of sea water level. If sea level increases\n        rapidly, several places will shrink into the sea especially, places nearer to the oceans and islands. Temperature of earth increases by one percent every year\n        due to global warming. If temperature goes on increasing like this, one day we will face several consequences.\n        Global warming is one the factors that effects not only human beings, but also animals and environment. If we want to live in a balanced atmosphere, we\n        should protect the nature. We are not protecting nature instead, we are producing greenhouse gases into the nature. Greenhouse gases are the main problem\n        for several consequences like global warming. The main sources of greenhouse gases are industries, bikes, cars and other motor vehicles. We cannot take\n        carbon dioxide for even one minute, then how can we that for whole life? Obviously, we cannot. So, producing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere is not a\n        good practice. We should reduce consuming carbon dioxide producing elements. We should grow plants as they absorb carbon dioxide and produce useful\n        oxygen for us. Without trees, we cannot survive on earth. We are cutting down trees and in return we are getting several problems like global warming. Global\n        warming also effects ozone layer which acts as a shield to prevent ultra violet rays hitting earth's surface. Ultra violet rays causes cancer in human beings and\n        ultimately results in rise in temperature of earth.\n        So, in my point of view, global warming is a definite cause for concern.", '\n        Global warming as being a huge environmental issue. It has become very necessary to increase awareness about it, among common public all over the world.\n        Students in the schools are generally getting this topic to write about something but there are not aware of it. Global warming is a major concern nowadays\n        because, of the regular increasing temperature of the whole atmosphere. It is becoming so powerful like a demon. There are many reasons for its ever\n        increasing nature. The major cause of it is green house gases like carbon dioxide, oxides, methane, carbons which are increasing in the environment mainly by\n        the human activities. Some of the increasing the use of auto mobiles, industries, fossil fuels. Health disorders are occur and invites so many natural disasters.\n        As every one of us knows that couple of century, the climate on this planet was colder than now, and it is so surprising that even now it is not stable it is\n        increasing day by day. We are well aware and imagine its negative effects on our environment and body health. However, we are ignoring our bad habits\n        which is flaming is a constant process of increase in the annual temperature of whole planet. According to the statistics it is recorded that in the last century\n        the average increase in temperature is less now it is increased. There are huge indications of global warming which is danger to our life. The main cause of\n        global warming re green house gases, many careless human activities. Fossil fuels burning for many reasons are highly responsible to atmosphere, people are\n        realizing well the increase in environmental warmth however they never mind their activities. Heating of the environment increases atmospheric temperature.\n        Global warming needs to be solved urgently by the active efforts of each and every human being living on this planet.', "\n        Global warming is the increase in the temperature of Earth's atmosphere due to the increase in Green House gases like carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide.\n        These gases are majorly released into the atmosphere by the burning of fossil fuels and release of these gases into the Earth's atmosphere. Recently, global\n        warming has been the most widely discussed topic in Conferences all over the world. Global warming poses a threat to the existence of many species,\n        therefore is a cause for concern. Due to human intervention and the extensive use of fossil fuels, the average temperature of the Earth's atmosphere has risen\n        over the last century.\n        With the increase in the temperature at the poles, ice structures melt which increases the sea‐level. Due to this, the regions near to the sea are completely\n        filled with water and the land percentage decreases. Global warming also causes a threat to the aquatic life in the sea. There are many instances of adverse\n        effects of global warming on aquatic animals. Sharks, whales and dolphins are becoming extinct due to global warming. Polar bear, a rare species, is near\n        extinction due to global warming.\n        From the last couple of decades, scientists have warned us to refrain from burning fossil fuels and have proposed a number of ways to reduce global warming.\n        Usage of alternative fuels like Solar energy and Wind energy which have a negligible effect on the Earth's temperature can help reduce global warming. The\n        alternatives are also eco‐friendly.\n        A lot of effort is being made by many organisations like the United Nations and governments of individual countries to create awareness among people to\n        reduce the use of fossil fuels and turn towards alternative resources. Yet, the net effect of the change in fuel burning habits has not changed much and people\n        must understand the threats of the continual use of fossil fuels and thrive to turn towards alternative resources.", '\n        In my view, global warming is a definite cause for concern because it already has significant and costly effects on our communities, our health and our climate.\n        Unless we take immediate action to reduce global warming emissions, these impacts will continue to intensify, grow ever more costly and damaging and\n        increasingly affect the entire planet.\n        In fact it is one of the biggest issues we are facing right now. Its effects on the animals and agriculture are indeed frightening and the effects on the human\n        population are even scaring. Unfortunately, even if we disagree about the causes, global warming effects are real and global. The causes are many, mainly, the\n        human race and hence the effects on us will be very severe. Global warming is also caused by the Carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel burning power\n        plants.\n        Deforestation is also one of the main causes for global warming. Especially the tropical forests are being cut down for wood, pulp, fuel and farmland. Increase\n        in the usage of chemical fertilizers on croplands is also another cause for global warming. The climate change is expected to have the most severe impact on\n        water supplies and shortages in future are likely threaten food production, hinder economic development and damages ecosystems.\n        The effects of global warming are the environmental and social changes caused by human emissions of greenhouse gases. Some impacts from increasing\n        temperatures are worldwide melting of ice, sea level rise became faster over the last century, precipitation has increased and hurricanes, floods, dro are likely\n        to occur', '\n        Global warming causes many effects to the earth. It mainly effects on ozone layer. Causes of global warming are deforestation, pollution and releasing of\n        excessive carbons from factories. Global warming is primarily a problem of too much carbon dioxide in atmosphere, which acts as a blanket, trapping heat and\n        warming the planet. As we burn fossil fuels like coal, oil and natural gas for energy or cut down and burn forests to create plantations, carbon overloads our\n        atmosphere. Carbon we put in the atmosphere today will literally determine not only our climate future but that of future generations as well. Global warming\n        damaging ozone layer, this results in the direct exposure on living beings. It results skin cancer and many abnormal diseases to the human beings. All plants\n        take carbon dioxide from air and releases oxygen, which is why they are sometimes to prefer to as carbon sinks. This process is called photosynthesis. When\n        land is cleared and trees or vegetation removed or burnt, the stored carbon is converted back into carbon dioxide. Many industrial processes, such as cement\n        production, liquid natural gas production and coal mining, produce or emit a very high variety of green house gases. Afforestation leads to decrease in global\n        warming.This means that it is very important to protect our trees.To stop the green house effect, and also so we can breathe and alive. New development\n        projects, requirement of land for homes and factories, requirements for wood and also soil erosion are the major factors that are causing deforestation, which\n        in turn leading to global warming. Pollution whether it is vehicular or electrical is the main contributor to the global warming. Everyday billions of vehicles\n        release various gases into the atmosphere. This cause earth to warm up and increase its average temperature. Electricity causes pollution in many ways. Over\n        75% of the electricity worldwide is produced by burning of fossil fuels. Many gases are sent into the air when fossil fuels are burnt of which main is the carbon\n        dioxide gas. So, it is our duty to decrease pollution and protect our earth from global warming. As we are educated persons we have to tell the people about\n        the effects of the global warming and put them into a path to save our earth from global warming.', "\n        Today our topic is about global warming.

Rise in carbon dioxide level is the use of fossil fuels like coal and oil,\n        deforestation by human beings on earth. Before planning the solutions of the global warming we must think about the causes and effects of it on the\n        atmosphere in order to get sure that we are in right direction of getting full relief from this issue.

Certain waste management and agricultural\n        practices aggravate the problem by releasing other potent global warming gases, such as methane and nitrous oxide. Our ever increasing addiction to\n        electricity from burning powder plants releases enormous amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.\n        Global warming causes: Deforestation, especially tropical forests for wood, pulp, and farmland. Increase in usage of chemical fertilizers on croplands.\n        Effects:‐\n        Scientists predict an increase in sea levels worldwide due to the melting of two massive ice sheets.\n        Scientists have come up with the firmest evidence so far that global warming will significantly increase the intensity of the most extreme storms worldwide.\n        Global warming as being a huge environmental issue, it has become very necessary to increase awareness about it among common public all over the world.\n        Global warming is a major concern nowadays because of the regular increasing temperature of the whole atmosphere. It is continuously becoming so\n        powerful like a demon. There are many reasons for its ever increasing nature. The major cause of it is greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, methane, chloro\n        carbons. Such activities emit more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere which enhances global warmth of earth. This increasing atmosphere temperature causes\n        glaciers to melt, health disorders to occur and invites so many natural disasters. All the effects of the global warming are the huge indication of danger to our\n        life. The main cause of the global warming are increasing effects', "\n        Global warming is the greatest environmental issue that need to be solved permanently. Due to global warming, the temperature of the earth is increasing\n        day by day. The rise in the level of earth temperature is the result of some habits of humans. The causes of global warming are deforestation, fuels. Global\n        warming occurs when carbon dioxide and other pollutants collect in the atmosphere and absorb sunlight and solar radiation that have bounced off the earth\n        surface. Normally, this radiation would escape into space but these pollutants, which can last for years to centuries in the atmosphere, trap the heat and cause\n        the planet to get hotter. The burning of fossil fuels to make electricity is the largest source of heat trapping pollution, producing about billion tonnes of\n        carbon dioxide every year. Coal‐burning power plants are by far the biggest pollutants. The earth's ocean temperatures are getting warmer which means that\n        tropical storms can pick up more energy. The impacts of global warming are being felt across the globe. Extreme heat waves have caused tens of thousands\n        of deaths around the world in recent years. The effects of global warming are melting glaciers, early snow melt, and severe droughts will cause more dramatic\n        water shortages and increase the risk of wild life. Rising sea levels will lead to coastal flooding. Forests, farms and cities will face troublesome new pest, heat\n        waves, heavy downpours and increased flooding. All those factors will damage or destroy agriculture and fisheries. It causes diseases like allergies, asthma and\n        skin cancer. Human beings have increased the carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere. It also leads to acid rains. Due to global warming, ozone layer\n        was damaged very badly which results in causes of skin cancer.", '\n        Yes, global warming a cause for concern. Today, pollution is increasing day by day which leads to global warming. Global warming means cutting down trees,\n        polluting surroundings, excess use of vehicles, etc., people are not aware of global warming effects. People are using air conditioners and refrigerators which\n        emits chlorofluorocarbons and damage the ozone layer. Global warming increase the earth temperature and start the melting of glaciers which leads to\n        drastic environment hazards like earthquakes and tsunamis, so people should take necessary precautions to save the environment like planting trees, using\n        less fossil fuels, decrease chlorofluorocarbons, etc., in the life style. Many people are cutting down tress, trees are used to increase the strength of the ozone\n        layer, tress provide oxygen to the people and they consume the carbon dioxide from the people and produce oxygen to the people. Many people know that\n        use of polythene covers is not good to the earth, because they disposal on the earth ground is time consuming, but many people are using these covers in\n        the shops and they are selling them illegally. People should change their mind set and begin to think that they have to take active participation to save the\n        earth from global warming. Excessive use of vehicle will consume more fuel and increase the global warming. Today, the earth temperature is increasing day\n        by day, during summer the temperature is very high due to global warming and during rainy season the rains are not accordant to the time. People are\n        becoming selfish and tend to use the resources according to there needs. Global warming is the main concern of the man kind. If this continues to happen,\n        the human race would suffer a lot. We should save our future generations from environmental hazards and we should save some resources to them.\n        Therefore, global warming should be reduced.', "\n        Many scientists are concerned about global warming. Research shows that the worldwide increase in temperature is getting worse. Furthermore, global\n        warming seems to be related to levels of polution in the atmosphere.\n        Our planet is gradually getting hotter, and there has been a significant increase in temperature in recent years due to pollution. The threat of global warming\n        as raised concerns as it is continuously causing damaging the earth in the form of heat wave, resulting in melting of glaciers whose persistence is utterly\n        important for mankind's survival. This essay will firstly discuss the reasons behind global warming and the solution for this problem.\n        First of all, usage of conventional fossil fuels in transportation and heavy industries has caused emission of harmful gases like carbon dioxide causing a green\n        house effect which creates a damage to the ozone layer. This has caused damage to the invaluable layer which protects our planet from getting hotter. In\n        addition, factories and thermal plants release huge amount of gases, polluting our environment and causing damaging effect to the world wide weather. For\n        instance, worldwide which equivalent to three nuclear bombs and causes enough damage to planet earth. There are many solutions like planting of trees, use\n        of non‐conventional fuel and solar energy, which can significantly help to reduce global warming. Planting trees will improve the level of oxygen and will\n        cause decrease in harmful gases as trees intake carbon dioxide as major component in their food. Non convention fuel like liquid hydrogen can be used to\n        reduce pollution from heavy industries and transportation. Finally, solar energy has developed as a major source in generating electricity this can be used in\n        many other domains to reduce the impact of air pollution.\n        In conclusion, a big threat is facing us in the form of global warming. It is the responsibility of every person on the earth to save our planet, mankind needs to\n        wake up in case we want to make our feature generations survive.", '\n        Global Warming means increasing the temperature of earth surface due to emission of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide from the industries and burning\n        of fossil fuels. Due to rapid increase in the usage of vehicles and auto mobiles, release large amounts of toxic pollutants into the atmosphere and cause for\n        increase in the temperature of earth. By using large amounts of electronic devices and plastic materials which takes more number of years to get degrade in\n        earth soil. Industries and chemical factories release large amounts of pollutants into the atmosphere and these gases settles at earth atmosphere and blocks\n        the way for radio waves to enter into the space and it reflects back to the earth surface and increases the temperature on earth surface.\n        Due to this global warming, glaciers and ice at north and south poles get dissolved and this will increases the water levels in oceans and cause for tsunamis\n        and floods. Pollution damages the forests and reduces the life in plants and cause for the degradation of plants and trees on earth. So, oxygen levels get\n        unbalanced and cause for more pollution. Vehicles plays a major role in the cause for global warming by releasing of pollutants into atmosphere. Man made\n        activities are one of the cause for the increase of earth temperature. Due to the dumping of plastic devices and electronic devices results to cause for global\n        warming. In the present days,global warming issue is becoming a major problem to all the countries in the world.\n        If this problem continues in the coming days, then it will become a severe problem to the survive of man on earth. So, people should try to reduce the usage\n        of vehicles and reduce the rapid growth of industries and stop using huge amounts of plastic. One should try to protect trees and forests, as they are the main\n        source for the reduction of temperature on earth.', '\n        Yes, global warming is a cause for concern because the current hazard is pollution. Global warming leads to so many effects and the main cause for this is\n        pollution and the usage of vehicles, freezers leads to the release of harmful gases. These gases releases in to atmosphere and causes global warming and this\n        destroys the ozone layer and the destruction of the ozone layer leads to the emission of harmful radiation. The harmful ultraviolet radiation reaches earth\n        surface by this, it causes harm to the people and also the heavy usage of refrigerators causes the release of dangerous chloro carbon gases in to atmosphere.\n        To avoid this problem every one should reduce the usage of vehicles. Global warming leads to the decrease of oxygen percentage in atmosphere and\n        increases the percentage of other gases by this, the survival of humankind is difficult. We know that due to the increase of population the forest area is\n        decreased and usage of vehicles is increased by this, the pollution is increasing day by day and to reduce the pollution every one should use metro buses,\n        metro trains. We can reduce the pollution by using these transport facilities because they are pollution free and every one should have the pollution certificate\n        for their vehicles. Government should take preventive measures to control global warming and people should plant the saplings to decrease this hazard.\n        Global warming is like a nightmare because it leads to acid rains which are very dangerous. The impact of these ultraviolet radiations on mankind is more and\n        sometimes it leads to death. Therefore, I can conclude that due to this global warming the people are suffering a lot and they are facing so many problems.\n        There is a proverb that go green and stay green by this, we can say that by planting trees we should be free from pollution.', '\n        The biggest challenge for every country is global warming and its effects on mankind. Global warming is an environmental issue which is threatening the\n        entire world from the past decade. Global warming is definitely a cause for concern because the pollution on the earth is increasing day by day alarmingly.\n        Deforestation, burning of fossil fuels, excess carbon dioxide in the air, usage of hazardous chemicals, polythene, plastic and radioactive elements are the main\n        cause for global warming. The effects of global warming are increasing sea level, heating of the earth, dehydration, ozone layer, carcinogenic rays. If global\n        warming is increasing, then the glaciers, ice bergs in Atlantic regions will melt due to the heat and increases the water level in sea. Deforestation is another\n        main causefor global warming and it reduces the oxygen percentage in the air and carbon dioxide will increases. Global warming is disturbing the\n        functionality of ozone layer by affecting the ozone layer. If ozone layer is damaged, then the rays from sun directly hits the earth which are harmful to human\n        skin and creates a heating, itching sense to people. Nowadays people are mostly using vehicles for traveling, transport and for general purposes which makes\n        the vehicles to releases more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The chlorofluorocarbon gases from air conditioners are heating the air in which results in\n        hot air across the world. The changes in the climate are due to global warming. If global warming is high, then water will evoparate quickly and the ground\n        water level will decreases. Pollution is also one of the main cause for global warming. The chemical wastes are releasing into water, smoke into air. This causes\n        pollution and then global warming. Global warming is a cause for concern because it effects the health of humans and causes hazardous diseases to the\n        people.', '\n        Global warming is the current damage to our world. It is caused due to harmful radiations and emissions of our daily gadgets and goods like air conditioner,\n        mobiles, laptops and many more which we use. It severely effects our ozone layer and causes harmful ultra violent radiations to fall on our planet. Carbon\n        dioxide is the main emission by chloro carbons emitted by the vehicles and it can be prevented by just following simple measures. The emissions of harmful\n        radiations are due to increase in technology and science, because previously we did not had global warming of this much level, but today we are having a\n        level which can not be repaired but can be prevented up to some extent. For preventing this we have to follow the measures which consists of planting trees\n        and not using vehicles more frequently for small distances, not using plastic much and making our environment green. The present level of chloro carbons\n        has already created a lot of damage and the chances to overcome or treat this are very less. One should be echo friendly and make our surroundings clean,\n        that means go green and stay green. We have to just make sure that the plastic which we are using should contain less number of polymers and we should\n        avoid developing new things which causes more radiations and try to create some devices which can create a friendly atmosphere to the planet. Global\n        warming is the main concern nowadays and for that many courses like environmental studies are introduced to the students in their academics to create some\n        basic knowledge about it. Pollution also causes much damage to our planet and for this we should try to make our country clean and green that means\n        factories and industries should try to minimize their pollution content to save our environment. Therefore, we should try to make our planet green and create\n        some awareness among people regarding it.', "\n        The global warming is the continuous rise in warming of the earth's surface due to the increased level of carbon dioxide gas in the environment. Global\n        warming has become a big issue which need to be solved by the positive initiation of countries all over the world. As gradual increase in the earth\n        temperature calls various threats as well as makes the existence of life hard on this planet. It enhances the gradual and permanent changes in the earth's\n        climate and thus affecting the nature's balance. Rise in the carbon dioxide level on earth impacts the human life to a great level through continued heat\n        waves, sudden occurrence of strong storms, unpredictable and unexpected cyclone, damage to ozone layer,floods,heavy rain, drought,lack of\n        food,diseases,death etc. it has been researched that increasing emissions of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is very dangerous in the life of the world. The\n        global warming is very important in the ozone layer of environment,the floods and droughts are in the life of many causes in the life of every person in the\n        world. The increasing level of carbon dioxide causes green house effect on the earth in the life of every world is very important in the life.In order to stop the\n        life threatening effects of the global warming. We should take a permanent break from all the bad habits causing increase in the carbon dioxide level and\n        other green house gases leading to the green house effect and then earth surface warming. We should stop deforestation,lessen the use of electricity, stop\n        the burning of wood", "\n        Today's topic is that global warming is a cause for concern or not. In my point of view, global warming is a serious issue that has to be concern by each and\n        every one. Several reasons are there that responsible for global warming. Several harmful gases and greenhouse gases that are releasing from large number\n        of factories are causing very harm to the human life. Greater number of people who are living in nearer to the factories are suffering from several non‐curable\n        diseases. They need to vacant from that areas to protect their children and their next generation. Government should take the responsibility of people and\n        should cease such factories those are affecting the human life. Those harmful gases and some unwanted things making leads to affect the ozone layer. Ozone\n        layer is affected by those foolish acts of people and factories and giving rise to direct emission of ultraviolet rays from sun to earth. Even though it is not\n        harmful for the current generation, but it will show severe conspiring affects on future generations. People should aware of global warming and should take\n        necessary measures to protect their lives. Nowadays, heat is increasing rapidly day by day and causing dangerous effects for people only due to lack of\n        plantation. Every one should plant two to three trees at their ones's houses. Even though several motivational programs and campaigns are running by\n        students of different colleges and schools, people do not taking them as a concern. Every one should their one's responsibility in protecting their environment\n        and should participate in a good thing of making their environment healthy. This generation people must take responsibility to protect their future\n        generations from global warming. Government should take severe action on some illegal companies which are destroying trees from forests for the sake of\n        their economy. Plantation and rehabilitation are the major measures to protect us from global warming.", '\n        One of the biggest problem facing the world today is global warming. The rise in earths temperature as a consequence of green house effect is called global\n        warming. The thickening of earth atmosphere is increasing due to the carbon dioxide and other green house gases is called green house effect. Scientists\n        believe that global warming is dangerous to the human life. Many problems are existing due to the global warming. It has been estimated that the heat after\n        50 or 100 years the temperature of the earth would be increased to a great level which would create big problem of living on the earth. There are some\n        impacts of the global warming. The impacts of the global warming are climatic changes, sea level change, water balance, human health. There are many\n        problems in regarding to the health because people are suffering from the many diseases like cancers, skin diseases and some other problems. There is also\n        adverse effect in the climatic changes. Our surroundings are getting polluted day by day. Another impact of the global warming is rise in the sea level this is\n        very harmful for the people. We can also find the water imbalance. We can prevent global warming by minimizing the emission of green house gases into the\n        environment. One of the solution is to stop the producing carbon dioxide. Another solution is to plant more number of the trees. Trees absorb the carbon\n        dioxide and produce oxygen which is not a green house gas. If we use less electricity less carbon dioxide will be produced. Scientists, government and\n        individuals should bring awareness about the global warming in our society. So, everyone should understand about the global warming and should take the\n        preventive measures to eradicate these type of threats. In my point of view, global warming is a cause for concern.', "\n        Global warming is the major issue all around the world. Earth temperature is increasing day by day due to global warming. Carbon dioxide level is increasing\n        in the atmosphere and this results to trapping the sun's temperature on the earth surface. There are many reasons for the global warming like burning fossil\n        fuel, deforestation, etc. An ozone layer is affecting due to the global warming. A man is using many natural resources for his daily usage, so he is creating\n        nature's in unbalance position. We know the number of vehicles is increasing very rapidly and the number of waste gases evolving from the vehicles are\n        increasing very much and causing global warming. We have seen, so many trees are cutting daily for our usage and the level of oxygen is decreasing. Polar\n        region is melting due to the global warming. Waste gases present in the atmosphere are increasing very rapidly. Industries are increasing very rapidly and\n        causing air pollution. Air pollution leads to many problems like headache, skin diseases, acid rains, etc. Acid rains cause many damages to the monuments and\n        food crops. Petroleum is the best fuel which are using daily and producing smoke and dust from the vehicles. We are using so many coolers that produces\n        many gases in to the atmosphere and these creating global warming. Global warming causes green house effect and it trapping the earth's surface\n        tempetature which is leaving from the earth's atmosphere. Burning of waste material from our own houses also incresing the waste gases in to the\n        atmosphere. It is becoming very difficult to live in this planet when the global warming creating nature's imbalance.", "\n        Global warming is one of the most important problems facing today. Global warming means increases the earth's atmosphere temperature due to green\n        house gases, such as carbon dioxide emission from burning of fuels etc. Nowadays the earth temperature is mainly increases due to more usage of fuels and\n        coal etc. The green house gases are trapping the sun rays and increases the earth outer surface temperature. Due to increasing temperature causes the\n        melting of polar caps so that it increases the water levels of the sea. Global warming is emerging issue for the world. Global warming is mainly increases due\n        to rapid industrialization, population growth, increasing of power demand day by day, and over usage of transport system. Due to increasing of these factor\n        carbon emission is rapidly increases so that more green house gases are release. Global warming causes the serious health problems like skin cancer, skin\n        diseases, and causes acid rain in turn it spoils the agriculture crops. It also causes the improper seasons high temperatures ,less rain fall etc. The world\n        environmental organisation should take necessary actions in order to reduce the global warming. Government should made law and implement law very\n        strictly. Government should establish different organisations for reducing emission of carbon dioxide gases and set the proper limits for the industries, for\n        vehicles etc. This leads to reduce the global warming. If any one the person or industry fails to follow rules and regulations made by government they will be\n        serious punished by the law then only global warming will reduce. The citizens also should aware with global warming and support with government actions.\n        Global warming should reduce by planting more trees. Tress releases the oxygen by absorb carbon dioxide so every one should plant tress. Government\n        should come with new traffic rules for reducing vehicles on road and implement tree planting programs.", "\n        Is global warming a cause for concern? Yes, it is a concern for the environment. Nowadays, global warming is more effecting to the world and it causing some\n        diseases to the people. In the environment, the main cause is smoke to form global warming and main effect is by green house effect. Global warming is the\n        increase of Earth's average surface temperature due to effect of green house gases, such as carbon dioxide, fossil fuels, etc. Its effect to the climate of the\n        environment and causes some skin diseases. The smoke consumption from the vehicles are also responsible for the green house effect and air in the\n        environment is spoil by the green house effect. Many of fuels are also responsible for the effects of global warming, because many fuels are mixture with one\n        another by cheap oils. This make them to profit in their financial status to get a lot of money and well settled in their life. To reduce the global warming, we\n        should follow some instructions or precautions like using of fossil fuels, releasing carbon dioxide, etc., are need to be reduced. Effect on the trees are main\n        cause for increasing the unwanted gases to the environment. To reduce effected gases to the environment, we should grow the trees, but not to destroy the\n        trees. Many of the people in the society are effect the trees and reduce the oxygen in the air and uses of the fossil fuels are also to be avoided, not to use the\n        cheap fuels and destroy the environment. It is easy way not to destroy the trees or destroy the environment with various factors. Every person or people in the\n        society should be responsible for it. Finally, I conclude that global warming is effect on the environment and it is responsible for every citizen to care about\n        the environment like our health.", '\n        Global warming is a big environmental issue all over the world. Due to, global warming the temperature of earth increases enormously this leads a serious\n        problems to mankind. The advancement of technology is one of the cause for global warming. Today many countries around the world starts to control it.\n        Human life is in a very dangerous position because temperature increases from day to day. There are many causes for global warming.\n        Rise in carbon dioxide level due to the use of fossil fuels like coal and petroleum. From industries a lot of waste materials are released into atmosphere\n        because of this waste air will be polluted. Usage of chlorofluorocarbon compounds release various carcinogenic components into the earth atmosphere this\n        destroys the ozone layer. As ozone layer destroys ultra violet rays from sun directly fall onto the earth many radio actives diseases will be happened due to\n        this rays. A lot of carbon monoxide is released from vehicles due to this the oxygen percentage undergo a drastic down fall. From mining various harmful\n        gases are released this is also cause for global warming. Deforestation results to the increase of carbon dioxide level in atmosphere as a result temperature\n        increases. One more major concern is increase of sea level by this so many low‐level areas are submerged in water. The humidity may increase due to the rise\n        of temperature, sometimes there may be a chance of acid rains. The usage of artificial fertilizers results in the decrease soil nutrition and crop growth falls.\n        The government starts many programs to bring motivation among people, the topic global warming has been introduced from schooling level. There should\n        be a complete ban on plastic. Afforestation is increased and thermal power generating stations is reduced. The laws that governs pollution and greenhouse\n        gases should be followed', '\n        Global warming is definitely a cause for concern because it can cause devastation. Our world can approach to an end, if and only if global warming persists.\n        Depletion of ozone layer is the main cause for global warming which can turn deadly. Green house effect is also a cause for global warming because of carbon\n        dioxide. The ultra violet rays coming from sun should reflect back into the atmosphere. Otherwise, temperature of earth will be increased. Plants require\n        certain temperature to grow, but large temperatures can cause a devastating result to the growth of plants. Natural calamities will also be definitely increased\n        because of global warming.\n        Actually, if the temperature goes on increasing, then the ice caps present in the polar region will melt. This can result in increase of sea levels around the earth\n        and all the coastal areas can be flooded by oceans. The temperature which comes from sun should go out in the form of vapors from earth. If the temperature\n        which has not escaped persists inside the world, then the temperature of globe will be increased. The chlorofluorocarbons which are being evolved from the\n        humans and vehicles will have a great effect on temperature and also on global warming. We should use environmental friendly apparatus for living in areas\n        like cities and towns. The earth in which we live should be treated as our mother and should be taken care.\n        We should cool the earth by following certain patterns. Forests should be increased in such a way that they can take care of every thing on this world. High\n        evolution of gases from fossil fuels should be released in a very less manner and taken care at every point of time. More and more rains can cool the surface\n        of the earth. We should give a better life to further generations of life.', "\n        Present days the severe issue being faced by world is global warming. It is caused due to over heating of earth. The main cause of global warming is carbon\n        dioxide. Others such as Chlorofluorocarbon and Methane. Chlorofluorocarbon are the pollutants released by the automobiles in the form of smoke. The\n        automobiles running at present days are completely running on fossil fuels. Due to the more usage of fossil fuels the raw materials which is presents under\n        the surface layer of the earth are gradually decreasing. So, there may not be any further fossil fuels and any other raw materials present for our future\n        generation. Some of the harmful gases which are released from industries reacting with oxygen in the surroundings keep on effecting our environment.\n        Global warming is already having significant and harmful effects on our communities, our health and our climate. Sea level rise is accelerating. The number of\n        large wild fires is growing. Dangerous heat waves are becoming more common. Extreme storm events are increasing in many areas. More severe droughts are\n        occurring in others.\n        We must take immediate action to address global warming or these consequences will continue to intensify, grow more costly and increasing effect the entire\n        planet which include us. To reduce global warming we should reduce emissions which we are putting into atmosphere. We should stop deforestation which is\n        responsible for 10 percent of the world's heat trapping emissions. We should start growing trees to stop the global warming.\n        Trees takes carbon dioxide and releases oxygen which is very essential for human beings. Growing of more trees helps in decreasing the carbon dioxide level\n        in the atmosphere and increases the oxygen level in the atmosphere. Every year we also celebrate world's environment day on December 5. Every one should\n        grow one plant for one week.", '\n        Today we are discussing about global warming a cause for concern. Global warming effects environment by burning like pollution. It causes many side effects\n        like environment pollution and spread green house gases. Green houses gases are the one of the reason for environment pollution. All we eradicate this\n        problem and reduce pollution. The people should have responsibility to reduce global warming. All the renewable sources are used by the people. The plastic\n        is the main problem for global warming. We all should reduce plastic and we control green house gases Deforestation should be followed by continuous and\n        immense afforestation, not allowing animals to graze at the same place because the content of minerals get reduced, reducing the use of plastic materials,\n        encouraging the products that can be again used, making judicious use of renewable resources so, that they will not become nonrenewable resources, a\n        general awareness should be created among all the sections of the society and everyone should be altruistic in nature and contribute to their full strength in\n        the development of the environment in which they are living. This sort of problem has arrived because all the people lost the minimum basic ethics and are\n        mainly egocentric, all should be philanthropist instead of being misanthropist. The human should know the value of environment and they should not pollute.\n        The global warming mainly causes by plastic products, because that we have to avoid plastic. By using plastic products the pollution causes so, everyone\n        should take responsible for not using plastic. Another reason for global warming are refrigerators,air conditioners. So, we decrease that air conditioners and\n        the burning pollution. Gases such as carbons are main cause global warming, avoid using gases. The main problem of global warming are burning like\n        pollution. Green house gases are the one of the reason for global warming.', '\n        In my point of view, global warming is a point of concern because global warming causes great damage to our environment. Nowadays our environment is\n        polluted a lot because of the dangerous gases and by cutting trees. Global warming is creating a lot of problem to our society and environment. The main\n        causes for global warming are gases released from refrigerators and gases released from vehicles and other poisonous gases. Global warming is mainly\n        caused due to these polluted gases that are settled in the atmosphere and make the world polluted. Ozone layer is getting damaged due to this global\n        warming and dangerous rays from ozone layer are entering in to the earth and they are causing health problems to the people on the earth. In these fast\n        growing generation the people are suffering with many health problems and global warming is creating additional health problems to the people. The main\n        creators of global warming are people they know that because of release of polluted gases the total atmosphere will get damaged. people know everything,\n        but they do not do that when that is their turn and they will give advises to other people. people should reduce the usage of refrigerators and polluted gases\n        then they can reduce the global warming. Children are effecting badly by global warming because children gets easily effected by the small disturbances.\n        Children are less immune when compared to the parents so, they are effecting a lot by the global warming. In olden days there is no global warming because\n        there is no pollution and no artificial things all are natural and man made, but now all are artificial things and no natural things. There are many trees in olden\n        days, but in this generation people are using the space of tress to construct buildings, factories, institutions, etc. People are the main cause for this pollution\n        and global warming. Everyone should understand the effects of global warming and they should not do that things to keep our earth pollution free for a long\n        time and for our next generation.', '\n        Today topic is global warming is a cause of concern or not. In my opinion, we should concern about global warming because finally we will face the problems\n        with this problem. We need to know what are the causes of global warming and consequences and solution for it. Actually, global warming means increase of\n        temperature in atmosphere due to some reasons. The main causes of global warming are vehicles pollution and sun radiation and natural calamities. The\n        smoke evolving from the vehicles leads to changes in the atmosphere. This smoke contains dangerous gases like carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide due to\n        these oxides temperature level becomes high that leads to earth warming. So, we should decrease the usage of motor vehicles. Nowadays people are using\n        more than one motor vehicles to show their richness which was correct. Sun radiation is also one of the major cause of increase of global warming because\n        ozone layer is getting damaged due to the oxides which were emerged from the refrigerator and air conditioners. For this reason, sun rays directly fall on\n        earth and works as a catalyst in the process of global warming. We have to protect the ozone layer by deceasing the usage of air conditioners and\n        refrigerators. Another cause is natural calamities like earth quacks, tsunami and tornado. Whenever the natural calamity happens, it gives the total destruction\n        of the place where it was happened. Eventually what I want to say is, global warming is the main problem that we need to concern. We are all rented people\n        on this earth and we do not disturb the environment. Recent survey is saying that the global warming is increasing day by day and if it is continued like this\n        entire living beings will face a worse situation. Unless and until we do not disturb the environment it protect us.', "\n        Yes, in my point of view global warming is the cause for concern, because due to the pollution that is caused by the humans.\n        Mainly global warming is the rise of earth's temperature due to emission of poisonous gases such as hydrocarbons from industries and vehicles, one more\n        cause for global warming is Deforestation. The poisonous gases that are emitted from vehicles enter into sky which form black clouds and results in acid rains,\n        and nuclear gases that are emitted from the nuclear stations is one of the major causes for global warming. Due to this the surface of earth's temperature\n        increases and results in the melting of glaciers in the polar regions.\n        Due to this the sea‐level rises and the climate cycle also changes. The only way to reduce global warming is afforestation and use of compressed natural gases\n        vehicles that are environment friendly and gases that are emitted from home appliances such as refrigerators and air conditioners are the cause for the rise of\n        temperature.\n        These are the problems that we are facing nowadays, so to avoid these firstly vehicles we use must be environment friendly and one more cause for the global\n        warming emission of industrial wastes into water, so that results in the loss of lives of the living organisms. The harmful gases such as carbon‐dioxide,\n        nitrogen‐dioxide, etc., emitted from trains, cars, buses, motor bicycles, etc., which results in the air pollution, so that even man cannot survive. These are\n        causes for the global warming.\n        Generally the countries near to the equator would have higher temperature than the other due to these gases it still increases where the humans cannot\n        survive. We can reduce this by growing saplings, so that it absorbs the carbon‐dioxide and releases oxygen into the atmosphere which keeps the surface cool.\n        In my point of view afforestation is the only way to reduce global warming.", '\n        Global warming is the main cause for ozone layer. In my opinion, global warming causes many diseases to people due to cause of pollution to surrounding\n        atmosphere. Pollution is the main cause for global warming pollution will cause due to many harmful gases. By planting trees and by decreasing pollution we\n        can protect our earth from global warming. Mainly, it causes many skin diseases due to ozone layer get spoiled so that sun rays will directly attack our body\n        from the holes of ozone so, our skin will get effected and causes different types of cancers in our body. There is also no proper cure for cancer.\n        The ozone layer is the important layer which will protect our human body from sun. But due to pollution nowadays the ozone layer get spoiled and leads to\n        mainly many skin diseases. At present global warming is the main cause we are facing on earth people should grow large amount of trees at their surrounding\n        places and protect the earth from global warming. Global warming will cause large amount of heat and produce many toxic substance into the atmosphere to\n        avoid that cause planting trees is very important then we can protect ourselves.\n        In the above discussion and above points mentioned due to global warming the ozone gas was getting spoiled and other toxic gases are entering in to the\n        atmosphere so we should protect our earth from global warming by planting large amount of trees and we should not replace the trees by constructing\n        buildings and industries. At present in our world global warming is the main cause we should protect our earth from global warming by reducing unnecessary\n        pollution. Pollution is the main cause for global warming and it is also main cause for depletion of ozone layer so every person should plant the tree. It isthe\n        only solution we can overcome from that problem.', '\n        Global warming is the major cause which is threatening the existence of life on the earth. Due to global warming a large amount of poles are melting resulting\n        in raise of sea level at alarming rate. These risen sea levels will make the natural water resources salty, making them not useful for drinking and irrigation\n        purposes. A lot of land will also get submerged in the ocean because of these rise in sea level. The main cause for global warming is air pollution from\n        industries and vehicles and water pollution. Because of these risen temperature levels a lot of species are suffering. The ozone layer is getting affected due this\n        global warming. Ozone layer is damaged due to this global warming allowing harmful radiation to reach earth which intern causes skin cancer and other\n        dangerous diseases. And the earth is also loosing its stability due to excess use of fossil fuels. The use of fossil fuels must be reduced in order to save earth\n        and preserve them for the further generations too. In order to reduce the global warming we have to make use of alternate energy sources like solar energy\n        and nuclear energy and make less use of fossil fuels. In order to reduce global warming we have to plant trees, less usage of vehicles, control of industrial\n        pollution etc. It not only the duty of government but it is the duty of every citizen not to pollute the environment around them and take necessary steps in\n        order to reduce the pollution which is already present in the environment. Everyone to take a initiative to plant a tree on his each birthday, it will reduce the\n        pollution. Everyone must follow "SAVE TREES SAVE EARTH." If your interested plant a tree but never cut the trees to reduce the global warming.', '\n        One of the greatest environmental problems in our time we are facing today is global warming. Many researchers believe that excessive emissions of carbon\n        dioxide, as well as other greenhouse gasses. Having a heating impact of environment and that is very harmful to human existence. Many problems might\n        results from the global warming and one of the out most problem is increasing sea level. By this, some countries might even vanish completely near future.\n        Global warming might also changes the weather patterns. Many areas of the earth are experiencing severe weather conditions, drought, floods, and other\n        uncommon weather conditions.\n        We can reduce the global warming by reducing the usage of heavy vehicles and by walking on the foot for shorter distances. By reducing the usage of these\n        chemicals emitted from refrigerators and air conditioners the release of these gasses will be reduced to some extent. We can not tolerate the persons who are\n        laying totally on these vehicles to move the shorter distances. We must plant trees to reduce some amount of carbondioxide and to increase the oxygen\n        percentage in our atmosphere. In the sense that, plants absorbs carbon dioxide emitted from all these electronic goods and in return they will release the\n        oxygen which is very helpful to our environment. One more important issue is electricity, which plays a key role in reducing the effects of earth. why because,\n        the gasses which were released through all these industries will be very harmful to the environment. In conclusion, if we make small changes now in the way\n        we live, we can avoid huge changes in the future. Scientist, governments, and individuals must work together to overcome this thread. So we must reduce the\n        usage of huge electronic goods in order to save the earth from these life dangerous threads and make a habit of using natural ways.', '\n        Today our topic is about is global warming a cause for concern? Yes, global warming means increasing the temperature of earth atmosphere causing different\n        climatic changes. Nowadays we all have refrigerators, air conditioners, vehicles, etc. These are producing green house gases like carbon dioxide, methane, etc.\n        These are the main cause of increasing temperature of earth surface. Some causes of global warming on earth surface is deforestation. So, we should need\n        plantation in many cities. Some causes of global warming are due to vehicle pollution. Global warming increases the temperature, due to increase in\n        temperature very hot in summer. Global warming reduces ozone layer in the sky. Deforestation is mainly done by building houses. It is also by constructing\n        factories which are causing harmful gases in atmosphere. Increasing temperature causes melting of polar ice bergs, due to this the sea level will increases. It\n        produces unwanted heavy storms and tsunami which are destroying many lives. Some of the problems like headache, brain dead, abnormal health conditions\n        are due this increasing temperature. To reduce this problem by increasing plantation and reduce usage of the old vehicles.', '\n        One of the biggest problem facing the world today is global warming, many scientists believe that out production of carbon dioxide and other green house\n        gases is having a heating effect on the atmosphere, and this could be very dangerous of human life. This essay will examine the problems of global warming\n        and suggest same ways as solving the problem. Many problems could result from global warming. One of the biggest problems is rising sea level. This could\n        result in the flooding of low lying coastal areas and cities. Some countries might even disappear completely. Another problem caused by global warming is\n        changes in whether patterns. Many ares in the world are experiencing increased hurricanes, floods and other unusual weather. A third problem associated\n        with global warming is the effort on animals. Fish populations could be affected while some insects which spread disease might becomes more common.\n        There are several things we can do to solve the problem of global warming. One solution from oil, coal and gas to renewable energy. Another solution is to\n        plant more trees absorb carbon dioxide and produce oxygen, which is not a green house gas a third solution is to use less energy and recycling the products.\n        Generating electricity is one of the main sources of carbon dioxide. If we use less electricity we will produce less carbon dioxide. In conclusion, If we make\n        small changes now in the way we live, we can avoid huge changes in the future, Scientists, government and individuals must work together to overcome this\n        threat.', '\n        Today my topic is "Is global warming a cause for concern." Yes, in my opinion global warming is concern to our environment and to all living beings. Global\n        warming is already having a significant and harmful effects on our communities, our health, and our climate. Sea level rising and number of acres are being\n        deforested all relates to concern of global warming, it results severe droughts are occurring and also some other factors. We must take immediate action to\n        address the global warming at what we are, because of that we start control measures to control global warming. If we continued in postponing the actions to\n        be taken on controlling measures global warming, we have to be ready to face the consequences of it. Globally the average temperature is increasing to\n        illusion of carbon dioxide, greenhouse gases in to the atmosphere, it results depletion of protecting layers of our planet. For all the consequences humans are\n        responsible for it, because polluting of air, water, atmosphere is because of us. From the past few decades we extracting minerals from the surface like oils,\n        due to that a hollow space is forming and results to earthquakes. All the above mentioned causes are typically results after a long time, where as extraction of\n        oils result is very quick and also causes great damage to human lives, property. The scientific evidence is very clear that, if we maintain our habitant in same\n        manner in future we search for a new home to live, and also present the warming rate rapidly increasing due to modernisation of daily life. We are not only\n        disturbing our lives, but also disturbing all other living beings along with us. This is not fair what we doing so, we minimise our daily to friendly', "\n        Today our topic is about is global warming a cause for concern and causes pollution to the environment. The rise in earth's temperature due to the green\n        house effect is called global warming. There are many reasons which harms the environment and causes pollution because of release of dangerous gases like\n        carbon‐dioxide and other harmful gases. Continuously, releasing of wastes in water like rivers or releasing of smoke will cause earth to heat. Predominately,\n        the atmosphere gets heated and cause disturbance to atmosphere. However, deforestation and overgrazing the area of forest will make the people their basic\n        infrastructure. In that case, it cause over heating and release of pollutant gases and ozone in the stratosphere gets damaged and causing dreadful diseases.\n        Eco‐balance is disturbed because of green house gases and the living‐beings in that region are reducing. Another the major important criteria is the\n        atmospheric change because of this the people will migrate from one place to the other. Certainly, this green house gas creates acid rains and will damage\n        beautiful buildings and in some cases causes diseases like cancer, skin disease and neural diseases. The necessary steps should be taken to reduce the global\n        warming are planting of tress at houses, use of smoke releasing vehicles and electronic goods. Probably, due to rise of temperature the ice bodies are melting\n        and causing damage to the environment and the most of the people are injured. Reduced thermal power for electricity need would help towards the reducing\n        of harmful effects on the atmosphere. There are several methods of reducing the release of carbon gases, by planting tress and use of the vehicles around the\n        the world.", '\n        Today my topic is about, "Is global warming a cause for concern". Global warming is the increase of Earth\'s average surface temperature due to effect of\n        greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels or from deforestation, which trap heat that would otherwise escape from earth.\n        This is a type of greenhouse effect.\n        I thinks that global warming is a cause for concern, because it effects the environment very critically. The humans need a very good environment to live on\n        this earth. So, we need to prevent the environment from global warming. It is nothing but to prevent ourselves from the greenhouse gases or effect. There is a\n        great debate among many people, and sometimes in the news, on whether global warming is real.\n        The climate scientists who are looking at the data and facts agree that the planet is warming. While many view the effects of global warming to be more\n        substantial and more rapidly occurring than others do, the scientific consensus on climatic changes related to global warming is that the average temperature\n        of earth has risen slightly over the past 100 years. The increased volumes of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases released by the burning of fossil\n        fuels, land clearing, agriculture, and other human activities, are believed to be the primary sources of the global warming that has occurred over the past 50\n        years. Changes resulting from global warming may include rising sea levels due to the melting of the polar ice caps, as well as an increase in occurrence and\n        severity of storms and other weather events.', "\n        The global warming is sure a major cause for concern. Nowadays, things have changed a lot. The pollution levels are very high due to the increase in number\n        of vehicles. Consequently, the environment is witnessing the damage on a high scale.\n        Firstly, the heat and humidity in the air is increasing on a very high rate due to global warming. This reduces the efficiency of the nutrients and the moisture\n        levels in the atmosphere. Thus, plants possess a great threat to grow in this climate. If this situation continues, then it may effect entire food crops and plants,\n        which is our only means of food.\n        Secondly,the entire climate is changing into a new one. Our body is accustomed to this climate and a change in this present climate is surely a threat to the\n        entire human race. We embrace our own destruction, by using modern equipment like refrigerators, air‐conditioners etc. The gases that evolve out of this\n        equipment, like CFC's poses a great threat on the environment. Moreover, those gases destroy the ozone layer. Several diseases like eye cataracts and skin\n        cancers are caused due to the depletion of ozone layer.\n        Finally, this global warming may increase the rate of evaporation to a very high extent. Due to this, the acids along with water also are getting evaporated,\n        which in turn is resulting in the formation of acid rains. This destroys the entire crops and stands as a threat to the entire human kind.\n        Eventually, anything which is misplaced in the nature will result in a catastrophe. We should reduce the usage of air‐conditioners and vehicles, which are major\n        contributors of pollution and hence global warming. So, everyone should co‐operate with each other in the process of achieving a good and healthy\n        environment. We must pass on the natural resources to the next generations to make them live a peaceful life.", "\n        The rise in earth's surface temperature in the consequences of green house effect is called global warming. The thickening of earth atmosphere because of\n        presence of increased carbon dioxide gasses is called green house effect. The main causes of global warming is deforestation and evolution of industries\n        these may cause the earth surface and rise the temperature to effect whole environment. The increase in population leads to increase in the development as\n        this is advantageous to the man kind for their advanced life. Therefore, this advancement cause a severe effect to the environment to increase the\n        temperature of earth's surface. The main causes is due to deforestation. As for the sake of shelter for human kind is going among the shelter of the animals\n        and cutting the trees as a result of this many of the valuable spices loosing there natural habitat. Some of the valuable spices are extinct because of\n        deforestation. And the main cause of increasing temperature of earth's surface is melting down of many ice mountains around the world as a result all these\n        quantity of water is going to increase the level of sea and ocean. However, the global warming is caused by our self and it can be cured by our self by\n        maintaining the current situation. There should be keep some law according to global warming, And there should be keep limit in the emission of\n        temperature and green house gases from the industries. And must we should share the vehicles in order to decrease the green house gases.", "\n        Given topic is about, is global warming a cause for concern? why or why not? Due to multi disciplines and development of technologies leads to global\n        warming. Export and import of products from one place to another place plays an important role that means global warming. From any place, any type of\n        product can import and export goods like manufactured goods, raw materials, industrial ware. Nowadays, global warming is increased very fast because\n        everyone supports goods from one country to another country or one state to another state like that from any place to any place because each place is\n        famous for particular goods so they market their products to get profits and also it leads to development of country. On other side, global warming effects\n        one's own country because other countries attracted people by effective products. For example, we take textile industries; culture is different from one place\n        to another place. At present many people are attracted for modern culture so they prefer western products so, the sales of textile industry in that place is kept\n        into loss. In technological developments, global warming is very effective and in some cases global warming leads to decrease in development of country\n        financially. Like two sides of a coin, global warming also has both advantages and disadvantages. Global warming is nothing but an efficient way of sharing\n        products, technologies and different goods from one place to another place. Due to global warming, some countries develop their finance; that invests in\n        development of country. Global warming plays a very important role in higher education; many students are emigrate from one place to another place for\n        pursuing higher education. Like that it is considerable in many cases.", "\n        Global warming is the rise in Earth's average temperature due to the release of harmful gases such as carbon dioxide known as green house effect. By global\n        warming, many gases are releasing due to this it can affect the ozone layer. When the gases get released a disease occurs called skin cancer. Global warming\n        result in deforestation which means cutting trees and afforestation which means growing of trees is not possible due to global warming. Global warming\n        occurs due to pollution. Nowadays, smoking is also one of the main factor for the global warming. By smoking, the environment is getting polluted.\n        Nowadays, smoking which is major cause of the pollution by releasing harmful gases. By smoking the atmosphere is getting affected which results in pollution\n        and also destroys the environment leads to global warming.\n        secondly, global warming results in ozone layer destruction so that the ultraviolet rays fall directly on the people and leads to diseases like skin cancer. Due to\n        global warming, harmful gases are released into the atmosphere and there is a reduction in life span of the people. Due to this, there is a loss in revenue to\n        the government and also the people who are depending on the industries which cause for global warming. Rather than banning of devices caused to go\n        global warming, government should take serious to control global warming like; increasing the tax to devices such as moto vehicles, washing machines which\n        caused to global warming or any other materials related to global warming. Use of cigarettes leads to environment pollution which results in global warming\n        also be banned in movies.", "\n        Today's topic is about global warming a cause for concern. Global warming is the effect of earth's average surface temperature will become higher due to\n        greenhouse gases, such as rising of carbon dioxide and rising of fossil fuels and due to deforestation. This is the type of green house effect. Greater number of\n        people are used in plastic covers to carry their materials due to this plastic bags, pollution will be increased on the earth. However, global warming is already\n        significant and harmful effect on our communities, our health, and our climate. The main reason for increasing global warming on earth is droughts on remote\n        areas and harmful gases released into the earth. Nowadays, the global warming increases day by day in our daily life. The greater number of diseases are\n        entered into human life due to a cause of global warming. The green house effect is the process by which absorption and emission of infrared radiation by\n        gases in a planets atmosphere warm its lower atmosphere and surface. The green house gases are effect on global warming by increase to release in\n        dangerous gases into the air. Nowadays, greater number of people are use mobile phones, due to this mobile phones the radiation will be increased in the air\n        and much effect on global warming. In the atmosphere due to sending of the rockets in the air pollution will rise in the air and effect on human life. In my\n        point of view, global warming can be decreased by increasing of trees. The usage of fossil fuel which results to destroy the ozone layer which is protecting us\n        from radiation. So, in order to decrease global warming plantation of trees and over consumption of vehicles without proper reason. Finally, I can conclude\n        that global warming will cause us very harm to human life.", '\n        Global warming as being a huge environmental issue.

This\n        increasing atmospheric temperature causes glaciers to melt, health disorders to occur and invites so many natural disasters.\n        As everyone of knows that couple of century, the climate on the planet was colder than now. And it is so surprising that even now it is not stable , it is\n        increasing day by day. We are well aware and imagines its negative effects on our environment and body health. However,we are ignoring and continuing our\n        bad habits which is flaming the global warming. Global warming is a constant process of increase in the annual temperature of whole planet. According to\n        statistic, it is recorded that in the last century the average increase of temperature and sea level by ten centimeters. All the effects of global warming are the\n        huge indication of danger to our life. The main cause of global warming are increasing human population, deforestation, increasing effects', "\n        Yes. Global warming is main cause for concern. One of the most important causes for global warming is increase in temperature level which may lead to\n        damage in ozone layer. Ozone layer is the only layer which protects the earth from powerful gases. The raise in carbon dioxide level leads to its damage. Man\n        himself is cause for it by his actions like deforestation, burning of fossil fuels etc. Due to vehicles large amount of carbon dioxide is released which leads to\n        damage of ozone layer. As population is increasing, the needs are also increasing which results in these actions. Hence, certain measures should be taken in\n        order to handle this.\n        People started taking measures for this. They founded a way to control traffic by sharing vehicles among the individuals. In cities they passed a rule that only\n        vehicle number plate vehicles should travel on roads on one day and odd on the other day. These measures must be taken if not there is too difficult for the\n        future generations.\n        If this global warming is not controlled then there will be hole in ozone layer which allows dangerous gases which will burn the skin directly. Ice in high level\n        areas will be melted due to heat and this leads to floods as all water will flow to low level areas.\n        Human race should definitely find new planet to survive there race if this global warming is not controlled. The global warming is the increase of earth's\n        average surface temperature due to effect of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide emissions from fuel etc..\n        Lot of industries also release large amount of gases. Measures should be taken to control this. At the global scale, frequency of cyclones will be decreased or\n        unchanged if this measures are taken. Hence, the global warming measures must me taken.", "\n        In my opinion global warming is a cause for concern. At present, global warming is a burning issue all over the world. Global warming means when sun rays\n        fall on earth some of the rays are absorbed by the earth and some of them are reflected back to the atmosphere. Therefore, the energy is reflected to the\n        atmosphere keeps the earth warm. The major cause of global warming is chloro flora hydrocarbons, which is present in refrigerator, air conditioner, auto\n        vehicles, etc. These hydrocarbons present in the electronic devices damages the ozone layer, which is present above the stratosphere. If the ozone layer\n        damages, the ultraviolet rays are directly enter into earth. Therefore, these rays damages our skin and leads to skin cancer and eye diseases. Therefore, every\n        person should take extreme measures to control global warming. Hence, global warming also effects the animals and small living creatures. At present, so\n        many animals are being extinct due to global warming. Due to global warming there is a cause to pollution in rivers, factories, industries, etc. In rivers people\n        are polluting wastes by throwing into river so that water is being contaminated. Due to industries there is a loss in contamination in air and increasing the\n        carbon dioxide value very immensely. In the glacier areas there is a hole due to global warming so that the polar icecaps melt to water and the content of\n        water increase enormously. Due to this there is no land it will cover full of water and creatures will be disappeared. Finally, I conclude that government should\n        take proper measures to prevent global warming. Otherwise, it leads to extinct of living creatures present in the earth. On planting trees this can be decreased\n        to some extent. This is because trees inhale carbon dioxide and exhale oxygen, which is very useful to sustain a person's life.", '\n        Global warming is the current issue which is being treated as one of the challenges to our globe. Apart from the terrorism, climate change and global\n        warming are being turned as the major problems and not confined to any particular region, these are expanding beyond their frontiers, as a result this\n        became one of the concerns to our human beings.\n        Global warming causes the environment to be not balance, as a result it is not raining properly and it has a lot of impact on the agriculture field. We can\n        survive only with proper food and nutrition, otherwise we cannot lead a happy life. The main reason for the global warming are the increasing consumption of\n        the fossil fuels and the cleaning of the forests. Today everybody is talking about the plantation, but they do not consider the ways to reduce pollution like\n        using public transport, avoid motor vehicles for small distances, using renewable energy sources, using cycles, etc.\n        Global warming is definitely a concern to the people, it does not help the environment to be on the required path and it pulls away from the original path, as\n        a result imbalance occurs among the different fields like the agriculture, employment, food marketing, etc.\n        Everybody should take contribution to make the globe free from the pollution and need to create awareness among the people about the importance of\n        natural balance to maintain a happy life by properly using the natural resources we were bestowed. One more thing is humans activities relating to the\n        environment should not be turn as any hurdle to the entire living beings.', '\n        Global warming is primarily a problem of too much carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Global warming is a cause for concern. Global warming is already\n        having significant and costly effects on our health, climate. Global warming is affecting many parts of the world. Due to global warming, the ice are melting\n        which, is causing the rise in the sea level. When the level of the sea rises, it causes danger to the people living in the low lying areas. When the level of the sea\n        rises, it covers the plants and causes some of them to die. When they die, animals lose their main source of food. Human beings lose our two sources of food,\n        plants and animals. It may also force people to lose their homes. In other words, the whole chain will get affected if nothing is done on time to stop global\n        warming from spreading its wings. Another cause of global warming is overpopulation. More people mean more demand for food, more carbon dioxide in\n        the atmosphere, more demand for cars and more demand for homes. The effects of global warming are the environmental and social changes caused by\n        human emissions of greenhouse gases. Industries on the other hand release various gases in to the water and air. Different gases have different heat trapping\n        capabilities. Some of them trap more heat than carbon dioxide. Pollution whether it is vehicular, electrical or industrial is the main reason to the global\n        warming. Every day billions of vehicles release various gases in to the atmosphere. This causes earth to warm up and increase its average temperature. We\n        must significantly reduce the heat emissions we are putting into the atmosphere. As individuals, we can help by taking action to reduce our personal carbon\n        dioxide emissions. Reducing deforestation can lower global warming emissions and plays an important role in a long term solution to global warming. Climate\n        change and impacts will differ from region to region around around the globe.', "\n        Global warming is the rise in Earth's average temperature due to the release of several harmful gases like carbon dioxide, carbon mono oxide leads to the\n        destruction of earth. Global warming result in deforestation which means cutting of trees and afforestation which means growing of trees is not possible due\n        to global warming.\n        First, Global warming results in acid rain and ozone layer destruction. Pollution causing devices such as vehicles, washing machines, refrigerators and many\n        other devices results in environmental pollution. Nowadays, smoking which is the major cause of the pollution by releasing harmful gas such as, smoke by the\n        people into atmosphere which results in pollution and destroys the environment leads to global warming.\n        Secondly, Global warming results in ozone layer destruction so that the ultra violet rays fall directly on the people and leads to diseases like skin cancer. Due\n        to global warming, harmful gases are released into the atmosphere and there is a reduction in life span of the people. Due to global warming, there is a loss in\n        revenue to the government and also to the people who are depending on the industries which cause for global warming.\n        Rather than banning of materials and devices caused to global warming, government should take serious serious to control global warming like increase in tax\n        to the devices such as motor vehicles, washing machines which caused to global warming or any other materials related to global warming. Use of cigarettes\n        leads to environmental pollution which results in global warming also should be banned in movies. Cutting of trees which means deforestation should be\n        banned and growing of trees which means afforestation should be implemented. . Due to global warming, there is also increase in death rate.", '\n        Global warming is certainly a cause for concern of present situation we are facing. Global warming is caused due to the emission of green house gases into\n        the atmosphere. Because of global warming, we are experiencing severe temperatures during summer. There are various ways through which global warming\n        can be caused. The first and foremost cause of global warming is emission of green house gases like methane, carbon dioxide and so on, from industries. The\n        usage of plastic basics is also a major cause for global warming. We are using plastic bags and plastic covers for every purpose. The plastic will not get\n        decomposed into the ground even after many years. Due to this, the soil will not be useful for agriculture. Another cause for global warming is\n        deforestation.Due to deforestation, the carbon dioxide will not get converted into oxygen. If there are more number of trees, they will take carbon dioxide and\n        will give us oxygen. The air will get polluted due to deforestation. Nowadays, everyone is using refrigerators and air conditioners, due to which some harmful\n        gases will be released into the atmosphere. These released gases will reach the ozone layer and there by depletion of ozone layer is done. Ozone layer\n        depletion is harmful to the earth, because it will allow the harmful ultra violet rays to fall on the earth. The gases that will be released from the vehicles also\n        effect the atmosphere.\n        It is our responsibility as a human to reduce global warming, otherwise we should be ready to face the severe consequences.Therefore, every one should plant\n        a tree, there by reducing the effect of global warming.', '\n        Global warming is the major threat to the entire world. It is a cause of concern because, increase in global warming results in drastic changes in environment.\n        Major causes for global warming is pollution. Pollution is increasing all over the world with increase in industries, smoke released from vehicles and carbons\n        emitted from air conditioners. Entire mankind should think of this concerning threat. If it is neglected, the future generation has to face a lot of problems.\n        Global warming is nothing but, the evaporation of the ozone layer. Ozone layer protects the earth from ultra violet rays emitted by sun. If we are directly hit\n        by those rays, we will have a lot of skin problems like skin cancer and rashes. Due to increased pollution ozone layer is gradually vanishing.Global warming\n        results in uneven natural conditions like increase in temperature, uneven and inadequate rainfall. Disturbances in natural phenomenon leads to loss of life.\n        Many animals are in danger of extinction due to global warming. If it continues in the same manner there is a chance of extinction of mankind.\n        It is not too late, we can control the global warming even if we are realized of its adverse effects. Major thing every individual has to do is to plant as many\n        plants as possible. Forest life is to be preserved. Cutting down trees in forests should be banned and should be considered a crime. Forests helps a lot in\n        increasing the oxygen levels which helps in reducing global warming. We have to make arrangements so that waste released from factories should not mix\n        with atmosphere. Usage of more number of vehicles and air conditioners should be reduced. Every nation in the world should consider this issue seriously and\n        should start awareness campaigns to educate public in this particular aspect. Hence, global warming is a cause for concern and steps should be taken\n        immediately to save mankind.', "\n        Today's topic about global warming. Is global warming a cause for concern? Why or why not? In my point of view global warming is harmful for society. Due\n        to global warming ice bergs in antarctic region are melted. Due to this sea levels increases as a result small ice lands are covered with water. Global warming\n        means increase in the earth's surface temperature due to the excessive use of plastic. Because of global warming earths surface temperature increases 2.5\n        degree centigrade. If there is global warming, then sea levels increases. If sea levels increases, then polar bears will become extinct. And ice bergs in the polar\n        regions are melting as a result water levels are raising as a result land available for humans to live become less.\n        Main sources for global warming are excessive use of plastic carry bags. If we use plastic excessively, then all the bi products of plastic are covered with soil.\n        These are not melted in soil as a result rain water is not absorbed into the internal layers of the earth. Hence, water stays on the surface of the earth increasing\n        the number of mosquitoes. These mosquitoes will work as a medium for several diseases like cholera etc. Because of increase in the temperature of earth's\n        surface Ozone layer depletion takes place.\n        We can follow several measures to stop global warming. They are using cloth carry bags instead of plastic. Reduce the usage of plastic. Stop using Air\n        Conditioner because, it release harmful substances like Hydro Carbons into the atmosphere. Global warming is benefit for those who are living in the polar\n        regions because, the average temperature in the polar regions will increase in those regions. Resulting in the better living conditions their. Global warming\n        and Ozone layer together cause diseases like skin cancer. Every human being should plant a tree because, trees take Carbon dioxide and release Oxygen.\n        Hence, global warming's effect reduces. Hence, global warming is good for some regions but, as a whole it is harmful to human beings.", "\n        Yes, Global warming is the increase of Earth's average surface temperature due to the effect of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide emissions from\n        burning fossil fuels or from deforestation, which trap heat that would otherwise escapes from Earth. This is a type of greenhouse effect.\n        The most significant greenhouse gas is actually water vapor, not something produced directly by humankind in significant amounts. However, even slight\n        increase in atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide can cause a substantial increase in temperature.\n        Carbon dioxide is the major harmful gas in greenhouse gases as it tends to remain in the atmosphere for a long time. Human beings have increased the\n        concentration of carbon dioxide by about thirty percent , which is an extremely significant increase even on inter glacial timescales. It is believed that human\n        beings are responsible for this because the increase in almost perfectly correlated with increase in fossil fuel combustion, and also due to other evidence, such\n        as changes in the ratios of different carbon isotopes in atmospheric carbon dioxide that are consistent with anthropogenic emissions.\n        Combustion of Fossil fuels, for electricity generation, transportation and heating and also the manufacture of cement all results in emission of carbon dioxide\n        which are leading to cause green house effect.\n        Due to these green house gases the ozone layer also gets depletion, due to this the ultra violet rays are falling on the earth directly which causes damage to\n        the earth, and human beings because as these ultraviolet rays are harmful to humans causing skin cancer. So to decrease the global warming we should\n        decrease the carbon dioxide content in the atmosphere, for this we need to plant more number of trees.\n        Global warming impacts raising of water level in seas, changes in rainfall patterns, Increased likelihood of extreme events, Melting of ice caps, spread of\n        diseases.", '\n        Today my topic is about Is global warming a cause for concern? In my point of view, one of the biggest problems that world today is global warming. Many\n        scientists believe that carbon dioxide is the one of the major problem for global warming. It is due to developing of industries and wastage of plastics which\n        are used by human beings are the main cause for global warming. Sun rays are directly enters into the earth in which some of them are inserted in it and\n        some of them are reflected into the ozone layer above the atmosphere. This essay will examine the problem of global warming and suggest some ways of\n        solving the problem.\n        Many problems that result for global warming in today technology. One of the biggest problem is that raising of sea level. this could result in destruction of\n        the areas in which that people are living may get damaged. There are several things that which we can solve a problem of global warming. Every human being\n        should have to plant the trees in their surroundings and why because that plants are the one of the living organs that which take carbon dioxide into them\n        and releases the oxygen into the atmosphere. One solution to stop the global warming is that stop producing carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide mainly releases\n        from industries through oil and plastic production this the main reason that why the global warming has been increased.\n        One of the best solution that how can we decrease the global warming is that electricity. If we decrease the generation of the electricity we can reduce more\n        the effect of the global warming and we can save the world itself. Human beings are the who can the save the world today by decreasing the effect of global\n        warming.\n        In conclusion, if we make small changes now in the way we live, we can avoid huge changes in the future. Everyone should over come this threat is that is\n        unity.', '\n        Global warming is the increase in the temperature of the earth. Temperature of the earths atmosphere is extremely increasing. It is primarily due to high\n        concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Establishing industries is also a cause for the global warming. Due to global warming the sea level is\n        increasing. The climatic conditions is disturbed due to the global warming. Ozone layer is distracted by the emission poisonous gases. The human beings are\n        directly exposed harmful sun light. Several skin diseases are caused due to pollution. Deforestation is one of the main causes of global warming. Government\n        of India implemented several acts to decrease pollution. Due to global warming the average temperature of earth is increased. Hence, it is considered as a\n        universal problem. Awareness campaigns should be organised. Everyone should be educated about the affects of the global warming. Plants should be\n        planted to reduce the carbon dioxide percentage in the environment. Farmers are facing problems and they should be cleared. The characteristic feature of\n        the resistor is to resist the flow of current. Similarly, we must resist the global warming. A capacitor is useful to store the energy. Barren lands should be used\n        for constructing industries. Rivers are being polluted due to the industrial wastes. Government should take steps decrease the pollution. Government\n        established pollution control board to control the waste materials and analyze the functionality of the companies. People should also help government.\n        Celebration of festivals also result in pollution. Since it is a universal problem, all countries in the world made some treaties. All countries has introduced\n        several acts in their constitution. Several projects should be implemented against pollution. Facebook should be used as a social media to educate the people.\n        Media', '\n        As we all know that the temperature is increasing everyday, due to global warming. Global warming is nothing but the increase of temperature of the earth by\n        the green house gases.\n        Global warming can be natural and man made. When coming to the natural one due to the release of chlorine free radical by certain volcanoes and releasing\n        less green house gases by some natural thunders. On the other hand humans are using refrigerators and air conditioners rapidly at any month, which results\n        in the release of chlorine free radical which can deplete the ozone layer, by this new skin cancers and new diseases are coming. Acid rains are increasing day\n        by day by which aqua culture had a great bad effect.\n        Green house gases are nothing but the gases which can trap carbon dioxide into their atom and their by emits large amount of heat, which can melt the polar\n        ice caps and can merge the whole land. Decrease of the forest land can also a great factor of global warming, because trees absorbs carbon dioxide and\n        releases oxygen, by which low chloro carbons. Many animals are endangered due to global warming, their life can be ended due to this.\n        Government should take care of global warming by giving some suggestions to the people and the people who are uneducated must know about global\n        warming. They should involve certain constraints such that every house should have a plant, which can reduce some heat. Deforestation should not be\n        encouraged they should be punished regularly.\n        A person can live more number of years if he so healthy, we all know that health is wealth and healthy mind lives in healthy body as our environment is good\n        then we are healthy, climatic changes are the major adverse effect of the global warming, which results in sudden fall of rains in wrong seasons which will\n        gives a bad impact on farmers. As air, water, soil are polluting everyday, if climatic changes are also done by the global warming their may be no human\n        beings on the earth.\n        Finally global warming causes a bad impact on ourselves. So please reduce the free radical causing things.', '\n        In my point of view, global warming is the main concern in our daily life. Every person can solve any problem in their life but, the problem which no one deal\n        with is the global warming. There is no way in stopping the natural calamities caused by global warming.\n        Global warming is caused mainly by pollution. Due to release of several gases by our vehicles, the ozone layer is getting depleted. Global warming is also\n        caused by deforestation. By cutting down the trees, we are increasing the amount of carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is the main gas which destroys the ozone\n        layer.\n        Global warming is also caused by the use of plastic bags. Plastic is the material which is not decomposed that easily. The animals which eat plastic dies\n        eventually. Due to this, there will be an unbalance created in nature.\n        Global warming is also caused by many factors. Industries release large amount of waste into seas, oceans. This will eventually cause damage to marine life.\n        They release dangerous gases which costs life of living beings. The pollution caused by an industry spreads up to miles. So, the people living nearby fall under\n        health problems. There are many other causes like using refrigerators, air conditioners which will damage the balance between nature and living beings.\n        By destroying the ozone layer, there will be many problems to living beings. Due to this, the ultra violet rays directly fall on the earth. Ultra violet rays cause\n        several health problems like skin diseases, cancer and so on.\n        It is our responsibility to reduce the global warming. There are several methods to reduce global warming that are being implemented. Every one must plant\n        trees to increase the amount of oxygen and must decrease the usage of plastic which are not decomposed. We must maintain balance between nature and\n        living beings.', '\n        Global warming is a burning issue in recent times because the population have been increasing from past fifty years due to medical advancements and this\n        has lead to ultimate growth of number of people living in cities and towns and advancement in medical technology due to science has resulted in this growth.\n        This reason stood behind the ultimate cause of pollution and not only this, the use of human resources due to population growth has been increased and this\n        finally resulted in release of waste and toxic materials into atmosphere.\n        The word global warming gives a specific meaning which is the increase of atmospheric temperature due to increased sun rays that penetrate into earth which\n        is the result of depletion of ozone layer. Ozone layer protects the earth from harmful sun rays from penetrating into the atmosphere and causing various\n        diseases related to skin. The ultra violet rays that are released from sun penetrate into skin and bones of human beings and cause harm to their structure and\n        also these rays manipulate the cell structure of plants which will hamper their productivity.\n        The above reasons are worth worrying for as they both are related to each other because the decrease in productivity of plants show impact on food issues of\n        both mankind and animal kingdom. The diseases that are related to global warming show hazardous impact on work efficiency of man kind which finally leads\n        the whole world astray. Steps are to be taken to avoid global warming and to protect the ozone layer to give a better life for future generations and these\n        steps must be implemented immediately.\n        Trees are cut down to build houses and apartments for the growing population and this has lead to less number of trees and to avoid this problem trees must\n        be grown in empty places where plant growth is favorable and the barren land must be used for construction of buildings. The factories and industries which\n        release harmful chemicals into water and atmosphere should be built away from populated areas and the wastes from these factories should not be released\n        directly into the atmosphere. The vehicles that are used by man also release harmful toxic materials and the vehicles which are releasing these toxic materials\n        above the optimum level must be banned. Protect nature to save the future.', '\n        Global warming is the great affect in any country in the world towards the major cause of pollution, it is because of increase in the dangerous gasses which\n        are releasing from the industries, those poisonous gasses atmosphere is facing a lot of problems and it leads to the damage of ozone layer because of this\n        destruction ultraviolet rays from the sun are directly falling to the Earth, many people are facing a lot of skin diseases and humans are getting affected by\n        cancer, so many people have died because of those problems. The main cause of global warming is industry, in those buildings they are not taking any proper\n        methods to reduce the affect of those harmful gasses, those are carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and chloro flour carbons. The gasses are replacing the\n        layers created by the climate because they are spreading all over the planet, it decreases the percentage of oxygen on the Earth and increases the percentage\n        of nitrogen and hydrogen, a man needs a plenty of oxygen to survive on the land, but it is becoming less, so they may face problems in their health. Global\n        warming also causes different types of pollution, those are air, water and sound, so these changes are affecting climate in a bad manner, sometimes they are\n        creating tsunami as well as earthquakes because of these unnecessary affects a lot people have died. Global warming is increasing the temperature on the\n        planet, particularly in the countries under the equator are facing more than seventy degrees temperature every day because of that much heat in morning\n        times people are frightened to come out from their houses, so at night times only they are doing their work in their premises, so every government must take\n        action to control the pollution as well as green house effect.', '\n        The global warning is the most concerned problem for every individual on this earth. The global warming is the state of increase of temperature of the earth.\n        Which leads for the melting of the polar ice caps on the earth. Which results in the increase of the sea levels that could result in the submerging the complete\n        land area on the earth. This process of global warming is due to the activites of the human for their new comforts of living. In this process, the humans are\n        cutting the forests for land and wood. Due to these conditions, the sources that could absorb the global warming gases produced by the human activities are\n        getting decreased day by day.\n        The increase of the global warming gases also got increased with vigorous increase in release of the harmful gases into the environment because of the\n        growth of industries and usage of the air conditioners, refrigerators and many more on the earth.\n        These consequences are resulting in faster raise of the earth surface temperature. The global warming is also leading for the depletion of the ozone layer that\n        is resulting in the exposure of the earth surface to harmful ultra violet rays coming from the outer space. This is resulting in cause of the skin diseases to\n        complete life on the earth. The exposure to these rays also decreases the life expectancy of living animals on the earth. The children of the next geneartion will\n        have very less chances of survival that could be the worst condition that could ever occur on the earth.\n        This kind of condition cannot be reduced at the instant. But, can be reduced by reducing the emission of green house gases and increase of the forest area. By\n        doing such activities, we can retain the hope of the good life for our future generations.', '\n        Yes, definitely global warming is a cause for concern. Today technology is getting advanced at a staggering speed. Everybody is really happy with this but,\n        there are many side effects that are caused by this technology. Today the use of air conditioners and vehicles are increased drastically. Due to this, pollution\n        has also increased which is a concern for environment. Along with this deforestation has also increased. As a result of industrial revolution farms are converted\n        into industrial areas. Ozone layer is getting depleted as a result of human activities. So,\n        everyone should come forward to protect the environment as well as to create the awareness among the people about the effects of global warming. The use\n        of plastic is also a concern for global warming. So, people should ban use of plastic. Our government is imposing strict actions on the people who are\n        violating the rules. At the same time people should also cooperate, only then we can protect our environment. One should encourage the use of bio‐\n        degradable products which really does not harm environment in any way. Everybody should understand the importance of environment in their life because, it\n        really has a great effect on every individual. Due to pollution there may be a great rise in sea level which drowns many important cities in our country. So, it is\n        the right of everyone to protect the environment. Government should also take some measures to protect environment. Everybody should plant a tree, so that\n        they can contribute something to the environment from their side. If we protect the environment, environment will definitely protect us. So, it is the\n        responsibility of everyone to protect the environment.', '\n        Today\'s topic is "Is global warming a cause for concern? Why or why not?" nowadays global warming is more increases. What is global warming, global\n        warming is nothing but the increases temperature of the earth. The main reasons for global warming are by depletion of trees some people cuts the trees.\n        Due to global warming many problems occur mainly due to this skin effects to humans and also due to global warming the water in pounds, lakes, etc.,\n        evaporates due to this problem there is no water for agriculture purpose and it leads to food problems and also due to global warming by cutting trees there\n        is oxygen level decreases in weather it leads the most effect on entire environment. So we must reduce or decease global warming by following activities are\n        we should be plant trees and decreasing use of vehicles due to vehicles, which releases harmful gases, which effect layer which leads reduces width of that\n        layer this leads to passing ultraviolet rays directly to earth thus, skin effects occur. Global warming is not a threat, which occur suddenly and after decreasing\n        like a earthquake. It is a threat, which occur slowly increasing and effects more it should not be decrease suddenly that\'s we must decrease global warming.', '\n        Irregular weather patterns have already started showing results. Increase of precipitation results in heavy rain. More global warming leads to more\n        evaporation it results in heavy rains. Main cause for global warming is destruction of trees it results more carbon dioxide in air. Carbon, methane,\n        chlorofluorocarbons are very harmful these gases cause global warming. There are four types of pollution air pollution, water pollution, light pollution, sound\n        pollution. Air pollution main cause is more amount of green house gases in air and also more amount of carbon dioxide in air. Water pollution main cause is\n        more amount of contamination in water and littering waste materials in water. Heavy rainfall also leads to water borne diseases like malaria. Light pollution\n        main cause is over illumination. Sources include night time sporting events, night time entertainment and big cities. Sound pollution main cause is because of\n        air crafts, bikes, buses. Vehicles causes more amount of pollution. Because of global warming animals may migrate to different areas and plants cannot\n        survive. We depends mainly on plants. It gives fruits and vegetables. Reduction of plants leads to food shortage. Because of food shortage wars and conflicts\n        may occur in many countries. Main cause of global warming is ozone layer depletion. Global warming effects many monuments in our country. It makes\n        temperature more warm it effects our quality of life. If we want to take general walk in garden because of warm it blows hot air. It is very difficult to lead\n        quality of life because of global warming. Global warming effects agriculture. If we want to take healthy food. It is very difficult in present scenario because of\n        global warming. Government launches many schemes not to throw waste materials and keep surroundings clean. Deforestation can be decreased by planting\n        a tree in our houses and surroundings.', "\n        Yes, global warming is one of the serious issue that the world is facing today. The meaning of global warming is that increase in temperature due to the\n        release of carbon related stuff in to the environment. This increase the rate of dangerous chemicals percentage in the atmosphere and also effects the life of\n        living beings.\n        The major reason for causing global warming is high use of petroleum products, reduce in number of trees, etc. The are many ways to reduce the\n        temperatures on the earth and one of them is by growing large number of plants. Dangerous chemical like carbon, amino acid, etc are the major harm\n        causing chemicals. If petrol is not burnt completely then the semi burnt petroleum consists of these dangerous chemicals and they will be mixed with air. If\n        once carbon particle enters in to the atmosphere its lifetime is more that 100 years and also it effects the ozone layer.\n        The most important part getting effected due to global warming is ozone layer which protects us from sun's radiation. Animals like birds are in a serious\n        trouble because of this global warming and radiation. Temperature of the earth is getting increased day by day and causing a major problems to the living\n        beings. Living beings are majorly effected with many diseases related to brain, heart, eyes, etc.\n        Famous species among the birds are at the end of their extinct and are getting disappeared from the world. This causing a great damage to the society. The\n        another major cause for global warming is due to industries because of their improper filtering of the residues in the waste they are dumping into the\n        environment. Following preventive measures like growing trees, purifying impurities before releasing, proper burning of petroleum products, etc should be\n        done in order to reduce global warming.", '\n        Admittedly, we can say global warming is concern to present day world. Once upon a time there is nothing which harms society ,but now due to lavish\n        increase in technology resulting global warming. Suppose you consider the past, only railways, bullock carts, horse carts, are the only sources for transport but\n        today we are having a lot of sources like buses, cars , air planes, and many sources are came into existence, and all these vehicles are using oils. Due to this,\n        the smoke coming from the vehicles releasing dangerous gases like carbon‐monoxide and methane gases. Moreover, usage of air‐ conditioners, refrigerators,\n        coolers releasing chloro‐flour hydrocarbons, all these gases are responsible for the depletion of ozone layer. These air is lighter than other gases, so by\n        reaching top‐most layer, these gases damaging the ozone layer.\n        Main cause for this is unrestricted usage of vehicles causing air pollution and this air pollution is the main reason for the global warming. If ozone layer gets\n        damaged, ultra‐violet rays will directly emitted on the earth which damages our skin and causes health diseases.The dangerous gases forming as a layer and\n        obstructing the sun rays from reflection of light rays, because of this addition to normal temperature these gases adding additional temperature. All these are\n        leading to the non seasonal rain falls, these things effecting the growth rate of the country.\n        Due to global warming, in pacific ocean some kind of measures are forming due to this we are not getting proper rains. And due to this the icebergs are\n        getting melted and increasing the sea‐level which may lead to the end of the earth. The only solution is planting trees, these trees will supply more oxygen\n        and pollution can be decreased up‐to maximum level. Secondly, we have to reduce yhe usage', '\n        Today my topic is about is global warming a cause for concern. In my point of view, global warming a cause for concern. The rise in the temperature is due to\n        the green house effect. Mainly, global warming is caused by emission of poisonous gases such as hydrocarbons from industries and vehicles, one more cause\n        is deforestation. Temperature is increasing day by day because of pollution and this will effect the global warming. The sea level increases due to green house\n        gases. The main reason is to reduce the global warming is afforestation. Due rapid increase in industrialization and population the need for human is\n        increasing. Due to green house effect a lot of population is increasing. One more cause for global warming is by the use of refrigerators and air conditioners.\n        Rapid change in the industrialization causes the release in the harmful gases. The temperature is increasing day to day life. The problems are facing in the\n        environment is pollution and green house gases. Due to rise in the sea level the climate also changes. To reduce the global warming people should reduces\n        the vehicles and motor cycles. Due to this the health problems of people are effecting due to the climatic changes. People should grow the trees in the society\n        and the trees will absorb the gases and emits the oxygen. People should reduce the mortar cycles and it will reduce the effects for the humans. One major\n        consequence of global warming arising out of green house effect is the rise in sea level. Although changes in sea level have received much publicity, problems\n        of water availability are likely to reduce the deforestation by water balance. Finally, I conclude that we should reduce the mortar cycles and there will no effect\n        in the global warming.', "\n        Today our topic is about global warming a cause for concern. The rise in earth's surface temperature as a consequence of green house effect is called global\n        warming. The thickening of earth atmosphere because of presence of increased carbon dioxide and green house gases is called green house effect. All these\n        are caused by deforestation and industrial emission results in green house gases like carbon dioxide around earth's atmosphere. These gases absorbs\n        atmospheric heat and causes global warming. This global warming causes very danger to our earth and us, and also causing climate change and become our\n        earth warmer and warmer. And also change in water level in sea shores, this leads to more danger to water living animals and plants. Global warming causes\n        many effects like ice sheet melting, polar ice melting and also thermal expansion on earth. For this, coastal cities and merged by seawater. Many cities may\n        vanish from earth surface area as well as from our world. Although, global warming causes water problem and availability of water also reduced. This results in\n        future problems of water perhaps more expensive to problem in future. Also human health leads to a problem which affects badly on our health and cause\n        diseases like skin cancer, headache. This also effect the buildings very badly and also collapse by green house gases like carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide.\n        The problem of global warming can decreased by reducing and controlled by minimizing", '\n        The discussion is about "Is global warming a cause for concern". In my point of view, global warming causes for concern. Nowadays, technology is increasing\n        based upon that global warming causes one of the reason for concern. Due to vehicles carbon dioxide is increasing one of the main reason for global\n        warming concern. Deforestation also one the reason for cause of global warming. Nowadays, trees rate decrease due to deforestation the human beings are\n        converting it into empty lands and building they own houses. Factories also major causes for global warming the factories releasing carbon dioxide, carbon\n        monoxide gases through their chimney. Using the major number of vehicles like bike, train, autos, etc., cause of global warming. When gases like carbon\n        dioxide, carbon monoxide causes affects to global warming. Ozone layer destroys due to releasing these type of gases and the sun rays are directly falls on\n        the earth. People who faces the global warming concern we can observe the symptoms like skin destroys. Nowadays, the deforestation also major affect for\n        the cause of global warming the human beings who are leaving near to remote area their cutting the tree based upon requirements. According to the\n        government survey, in last month due to deforestation we nearly lost two crores.', "\n        Global warming is the rise of heat on the earth surface. The global warming effects all the living organisms in the world. Mainly the global warming is caused\n        by the burning of fuels and increasing the carbon dioxide on the earth. It makes the earth's temperature to rise and increase the effects natural calamities. The\n        main cause of the global warming is carbon dioxide, because in the present day life the carbon dioxide is increasing day by day due to the increase of\n        automobiles, factories and lack of trees around us. The one of the cause of global warming is cutting trees and increase of urbanization. Nowadays the\n        population is increasing day by day, so the forests are decreasing. The climatic conditions like storms, wind and heavy rain falls, these are caused by global\n        warming. The man is only responsible for all these kinds of activities. The present day life is mainly based on automobiles. The automobiles release the\n        dangerous gases like carbons into the air. The ozone layer is also gets effected by this pollution, hence the dangerous ultraviolet rays are coming directly to\n        the earth. So, this makes the more increase of the global warming. The green house effect also one of the reason of the global warming. The government is\n        planning to reduce the global warming by planting trees and by reducing the cutting of trees. The rain is not coming in the particular season, so it makes the\n        farmers to lose their crops. The Delhi is maintaining rules like should not go on their own transport and should use the public transports. This is a great idea,\n        because the most pollution state like Delhi is maintaining strict rules to reduce pollution. We should inspire these activities to reduce pollution and maintain\n        the earth's temperature constant. I conclude that global warming should reduce by increasing trees.", "\n        Global warming is the biggest problem all around the world. Global warming can be defined as the increase in the temperature of Earth's atmosphere\n        corresponding to climatic changes. Deforestation, use of vehicles on a large scale, household equipment like refrigerators are the major causes of global\n        warming. The use of these must be reduced to reduce the effect of global warming. Global warming leads to many causes like melting of polar icebergs,\n        increase in temperature, heavy storms, which lead to a large damage of lives and property.\n        Global warming can be reduced by less usage of carbon emitting devices and machines. Industries are also one of the main cause of global warming, by\n        releasing smoke and other harmful gases causing severe damage to the earth's atmosphere. Industries must take necessary steps to reduce the effect of this\n        effects causing global warming. Carbon dioxide, methane are the gases which are responsible for global warming. GLOBAL WARMING will make the lives of\n        animals and human beings in a worst situation. Global warming should be reduced to lead a healthy life on earth's surface. Yes, global warming is a cause to\n        earth's atmosphere. Finally, we can say that global warming should be reduced and some steps should be taken to make lives better.", "\n        Global warming means raise of earth temperature and sea levels. The main reasons and impacts of global warming are temperature and plastic use is the\n        main impacts of the global warming. They have to reduce the global warming are decrease use of plastic material, it is earth surface. Deforestation and\n        industrial emissions result to an increase greenhouse gases around earth's major problem.On major consequences of global warming arising out of\n        greenhouse effect is the rise in sea level. The major effect and impact of the greenhouse gases are to reduce the earth surface, in our earth surface major\n        effects are there, the main cause's of the global warming in industries and sea levels, many rides and increases the smoking level then effect the global\n        warming.

The major effects of the greenhouse gases are earths surface on major consequences of global warming are arising out. Finally the\n        greenhouse gases are arising them.", '\n        Global warming is defined as the overall increase in temperature of the earth atmosphere is generally attributed to green house effect. It was caused by\n        pollutant substances like carbon dioxide, methane. In twenty first century global warming mainly increases due to increase in industries. Industries release\n        harmful gases like carbon dioxide and other harmful substance into air. As a result air is polluted and it is also one of the reason for global warming.\n        Nowadays transportation services also increases and as a result harmful gases are release into air. Global warming also causes due to burning of fossil fuel in\n        power plants. Even some animals release methane it is also a cause for global warming. One of the major cause for global warming is deforestation.\n        Nowadays man cut down forests for commercial purpose as a result area of forests decrease day by day. Plants take carbon dioxide and release oxygen in to\n        air. As a result of deforestation carbon dioxide increases day by day. Global warming effects our earth like increasing overall level of water of seas. It effects\n        wide spread extinction of species. Many species get extinction due to global warming. Because global warming the climatic conditions also changes.\n        Nowadays there is no rainfalls in rainy seasons and even summer season is very hot than the previous century. There is increase in natural disasters like\n        earthquake, tsunami, storms. There are some preventive measures to be take by every single person to reduce global warming. Deforestation must be\n        stopped and plant trees, reduce the use motor vehicles, and the industries must construct according to pollution control board. It is our duty to save our\n        earth.', '\n        The given topic is about global warming. In my view global warming is cause for concern because, global warming is the main reason for abnormal deaths,\n        uneven rainfall, and also other natural calamities like earthquakes, volcano eruption etc. If man continue the same life style in future earth will be heated like\n        sun. To avoid this man should take some safety measures like planting trees, decreasing pollution, deforestation etc. By planting trees an oxygen will be\n        produced and heat on our earth will be decreased.\n        The main thing that a man should remember is to save the ozone layer so, that the ultra violent rays falling directly on earth will be eradicated. The ultra\n        violent rays are very dangerous they can cause diseases like skin cancer and many other skin diseases. The main cause for spoiling ozone layer was the\n        chemicals produced from air conditioners. Up to the date thirty three percent of the ozone layer was spoiled. If it continuous like this hundred percent of the\n        ozone layer will be spoiled and no living being including plants and trees cannot continue there life on earth. The main pollution is due to factory chemical\n        outlet, the smoke coming out from cars and big tunnels in the factory are the main cause of air pollution. The wastes that are mixing in the water causes water\n        pollution. In these days even seasons are not coming on time. In rainy season it was hot and in summer season it was raining. Due, to this the life span of the\n        human beings also decreasing day to day. If all the humans decrease their pollution automatically the globa', "\n        Today's topic is about global warming. One of the biggest issues facing us right now is global warming. Due to the comfort of the people living on earth they\n        do many mistakes related to cause global warming. Some mistakes are done without their presence and some are done for their comfort. The reasons of\n        causing global warming are releasing gasses directly into atmosphere without filtering. Nowadays every one has his own vehicle to travel one place to other.\n        They don't know that how much pollution causes by that vehicles, they release smoke into the environment containing carbon‐ dioxide which is one of the\n        reason to increase the temperature of the earth. Many industries releases dangerous gases into atmosphere, that will lead to destroy the ozone layer which is\n        protecting from radiation. The second reason is deforestation caused by the people. In order to live they have to construct house due to population increase\n        in the world they cut down the tress. Tress is the best things which give the most use to earth. Next reason is use of chemicals as fertilizers in fields. No one is\n        using natural fertilizers which is coming from animals. All are using very dangerous chemicals as fertilizers. Due to global warming the temperature of the\n        earth increases as a result the ice in the ice mountains will melt and passes to lakes, rivers. We have 75% water and remaining 25% land on earth, If the water\n        level is increase very much then people live on earth on very difficult. All the earth is filled with water no human being can live.", '\n        Global warming is one of the major issue that everyone should be concerned because of global warming, human beings are facing a negative impact on their\n        health. Global warming is also showing its negative impact on the environment. This happens due to many reasons like depletion of ozone layer, use of\n        natural resources without any proper knowledge, using the minerals and mines to fulfill our needs without any limit. Pollution is one of the main reason for\n        global warming because it causes the depletion of ozone layer very rapidly. Depletion of the ozone layer causes irregular seasonal changes like irregular\n        temperatures, irregular and inadequate rainfalls and we can also see the improper seasonal changes. These changes will have a huge impact on the health of\n        human beings, animals, plants and many other creatures which will doubt their existence in the real world because we can see that many aged persons and\n        children are dying due to the irregular seasonal changes. The other cause for the ozone depletion is the use of the carbon molecules very excessively which\n        will the destroy the ozone layer completely. The gases that are being evolved from the fridges, air conditioners, coolers are very dangerous which will the\n        destroy ozone layer. Destruction of the ozone layer causes many skin diseases, reduction of the oxygen levels and increase of the carbon dioxide levels which\n        will doubt the survival of human beings and many other living creatures.\n        Ozone layer should be protected in order to protect ourselves from the global warming because ozone layer is like a wall which is protecting us from the\n        radiation of sun. This layer can be protected by reducing the use of vehicles, fridges and other things which causes the pollution and everyone should plant a\n        tree to protect themselves from global warming. Everyone should take some initiative to reduce the global warming.', '\n        Yes, global warming is a cause for concern. In my point of view, global warning is one of the main important problem that our world was facing. Global\n        warming can be caused by cutting the trees in the forests and polluting the air by industries and their harmful gases. Global warming will cause many\n        dangerous climatic changes. The climatic changes will be changed from season to season and the temperatures and rainfall will be more. Global warming will\n        be cured when the cutting of forest trees and plants in the atmosphere. The global warming will also causes destruction of the ozone layer and it also causes\n        by releasing harmful gases and smoke into the air. Nowadays, our universe is facing some problems regarding to global warming. The main thing is\n        destroying the trees and cutting them and also by releasing harmful gases into the atmosphere. Global warming can be lead to the effect of some cyclones\n        and earthquakes and tsunami. When the rainfall will be low the effect for farmers will be more and there is no fulfilled water to drink and to use in our day to\n        day life. Global warming causes many dangerous effect in the atmosphere by changing the climatic seasons and by increasing in temperatures in summer\n        season. Global warming will be settled when destruction of trees and pollution are decreased and maintained in a balanced level. Global warming is one of\n        the cause for pollution and climatic changes. The human being must need to save the trees and water and to stop releasing polluted air and harmful gases\n        into the atmosphere. When these harmful gases are evolved into the air they will cause some destruction in the surrounding atmosphere. So, the industries\n        will be banned, if they pollute the atmosphere.', '\n        Global warming is the very common word that we come across everyday and we all know that it increases the temperature on the earth very rapidly. Today,\n        the major problem of the entire world is, the temperature in every country is getting increased from the past three decades. In every home, there are\n        electronic devices like televisions, mobile phones which are releasing larger amounts of radiation into the atmosphere which resulting in the damage of ozone\n        layer. The usage of refrigerators, air conditioners are increasing at a larger rate and this machines release gases into the atmosphere which are polluting the\n        entire world. On the other hand, the increase in population is also playing a major role in global warming. The increase in population increases the rate of\n        oxygen intake and decreases the rate of oxygen present in the atmosphere. As a result, the percentage of carbon dioxide is also increases and this gas\n        contributes to the increase in the levels of temperature. The number of vehicles in the present world is getting increased everyday and this vehicles evolve\n        harmful gases into the atmosphere which gives rise to dangerous environment. Human beings cannot survive at high temperatures and the present rise in\n        temperatures makes them sit inside the houses and switch on their air conditioners. They are not recognizing that their own devices are leading to the\n        increase in temperature levels. Every individual should feel responsible and should reduce the usage of all devices which contribute for the rise in harmful\n        gases and leads global warming. If we see for our comforts, our future generations will suffer a lot due to the pollution made by the present generations. In\n        developed countries, every house consists of luxurious equipment like cars, mobiles, refrigerators and many other devices. The government should provide\n        some suggestions for the citizens to reduce the pollution and global warming.', "\n        Today my topic is global warming a cause for concern. In my point of view, global warming is a cause of concern. Global warming is the reason for heating of\n        earth and it is the reason for destroying the ozone layer which presented in between the earth and people. Sun rays are directly entering into the earth\n        because of global warming and affecting the people. People are suffering with diseases like cancer, skin allergies. Nowadays usage of plastic was increasing,\n        due to this global warming is increasing in same proportion. Plastics is one of the major reason behind the global warming. Compared to advantages of\n        global warming there are more disadvantages of global warming. Plants are destroying due to the global warming. We can stop global warming by many\n        measures, by stopping the usage of plastic and increasing the plants. We can stop global warming by increasing the plants around our own house. Global\n        warming is the main reason for destroying main animals. Global warming is the main reason for melting the water, due to this water percentage in the earth is\n        increase. If the water percentage increases the earth may be full of water. Global warming means heating of earth. When the sun rays touch the earth, some of\n        them are absorbed and some are reflected. The reflected rays enter into the atmosphere, and carbon dioxide and green gasses lead to the global warming.\n        They will reflect those rays to the earth, which are the reason for heating of earth. Global warming and climate change are terms for the absorb raise the\n        temperature of the earth and its related effects. Many of the absorbed changes since the 1950's are unprecedented over tens to thousands of years. Finally, I\n        conclude global warming is the main reason for destroying the plants and people life.", "\n        In my opinion, global warming is one of the main problem having on the earth. Global warming increases the earth's temperature. This is caused by the\n        human activities they are, cutting of tress, burning of fossil fuels, emission of carbon dioxide gas, deforestation, decreasing of agriculture. Nowadays, people\n        are cutting the trees in the forest areas for their business this will increase the temperature on the earth. Deforestation makes increase of carbon dioxide gas\n        this will increase the earths temperature, some of the industries also responsible for the cause of global warming. From the industries some dangerous gases\n        are released in to the atmosphere so that the temperature of the earth will be increased which in turn causes global warming. Another cause for global\n        warming is burning of fossil fuels, which will cause more heat on the earth. Nowadays, humans are throwing waste every where in the atmosphere this will\n        also cause global warming. Heat on the earth will be reduced by increasing the trees, making the environment clean and green, burning of fossil fuels should\n        be reduced, increase of carbon dioxide gas should be reduced, cutting of trees should be reduced. Government should take take serious action on the people\n        who are cutting the trees, industries which are releasing dangerous gases into the atmosphere should be banned.\n        Global warming is also controlled by placing nuclear power plants because, these will reduce some of the heat on the earth, Nuclear power plants are costly\n        and dangerous for use, but this will reduce the global warming on the earth. Therefore humans should reduce global warming by planting trees.", '\n        In my point of view global warming is the primarily too much carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Global warming increases mainly due to deforestation, i.e.,\n        cutting down of forests. The destruction of trees results increases of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere which increases the temperature of the\n        environment.The carbon dioxide mainly increases due to vehicles and industries which release lot of pollution. We decreases the global warming by planting\n        the trees and decrease the use of the air conditioners and refrigerators. The usage of this air conditioners increases the pollution in the form\n        chlorofluorocarbon which increases the pollution in the form of heat and the level of carbon dioxide also increases which increases the temperature of the\n        atmosphere. The improvement of technology also cause of pollution. We can use many of the inventions which causes damages to the environment. For\n        example we use more vehicles, everyone has own vehicle which increases pollution. The technology like refrigerators emits the hydrocarbons to the\n        environment which increases the temperature. The temperature increase cause the environment diminishes. The present technology increases day by day due\n        to this the atmosphere damages and finally it leads to great damage to humans. We decreases the usage of the technology which harms the environment\n        hten global warming decreases. We increases the trees and the decrease the usage of the polythene we decreases the pollution. Mainly environment damages\n        because of polythene, everyone should aware of the harm causes polythene which increases the temperature when burns and does not decompose in the\n        earth for sev', "\n        Yes, global warming a cause for concern. The rise in earth's surface temperature as a consequence of greenhouse effect is called global warming. If global\n        warming continues, the world would be in danger. The major effects and impacts of global warming are due to climate change, sea level change, water\n        balance, human health, deforestation, increase in growth of industries and factories. Nowadays, the comforts of the people are getting increased. So the use\n        of luxury materials are getting increased. The materials like air conditioners and refrigerators are using in our day to day life. These air conditioners and\n        refrigerators release chloro flora carbons into the atmosphere. These carbons are very dangerous to earth's surface. These carbons damage the layers above\n        the earth's surface, which are preventing us from many dangerous radiations.\n        The problems of global warming can be decreased by minimizing the emission of greenhouse gases into the environment. Some preventive steps would help\n        us to save our earth from harmful effects of global warming. We have to reduce the thermal power generating stations. We should not waste paper. We\n        should control deforestation. The increasing rate of developing industries and factories should be decreased. So that the wastes, which are coming from the\n        factories will be decreased up to some extent. We have to plant the new trees in empty places. So that, trees absorb harmful gases and releases oxygen. Trees\n        can reduce the problems of global warming. We can share our car, while going to office or performing other schedule activities. Thus we will emit less\n        greenhouse gases and we can reduce the effect of global warming up to some extent.", '\n        Today our topic is about Is "global warming a cause for concern? why or why not?" global warming is caused due to increase of temperature in the earth\n        surface as a result so many problems arises. Gases that are released from the factories are very dangerous those gases creating so many health problems. Due\n        to deforestation number of trees are decreasing day by day as a result oxygen content in the environment decreases. If oxygen content is less in environment\n        people and all living things are effected to health problems. Most of the people throw waste on to the roads from their houses and factories. As a result those\n        waste mixed with water and it creates water change. Water in the seas and oceans are also effected due to temperature changes it effects the fishes in water.\n        Global warming creates many problems like fever, dehydration and other problems. Nowadays vehicles are increasing day by day they are releasing\n        dangerous gases they effect us very badly. Global warming can be reduced by minimizing the green house gases that are released from the vehicles, factories,\n        air conditioners and refrigerators. Trees are very useful to reduce the green house gases because trees absorbs carbon di oxide and releases oxygen into the\n        atmosphere which is very useful to living things so, we grow maximum number of plants we definitely reduce the problem of global warming. Government\n        should take necessary steps to reduce the pollution. Not only government but also it is our duty to take care of our environment. If people share cars while\n        they are going for work or any other industrial importa', '\n        Global warming is major concern nowadays because of the regular increasing temperature of the whole of at atmosphere. It is continuously becoming\n        so,powerful like a demon. There many reasons for its ever increasing nature.The major cause of it is greenhouse gases like carbon oxide, oxide , methane\n        chloro carbons. Which are increasing in the environment mainly by the human activities.Some are increasing number of automobiles, industries, fuels\n        combustion, such activities emit the global warm of earth. This increasing the atmospheric temperature causes global warming. health diseases. It is increasing\n        day by day. We are well aware and imagine its negative effects on our environment and body health. However, we are ignoring and continuing our bad habits\n        which is flaming the global warming. All the effects of global warming are huge indication of danger to our life. The main causes of global warming are\n        increasing human population, deforestation, increase in effects of green house gases. Many careless human activities and many more, the main of cause of\n        global warming is human being careless activities. Ever increasing human population are demanding more resources to live easy and healthy life such as land\n        to live and crop cultivation , technologies growth for comfort and deal with increasing temperature of the temperature, increasing inventions of the\n        technologies such as refrigerators, air conditioners, microwave, washing machines, electronic devices because of the increasing needs of human beings for\n        technologies in order to make their life, easy and luxurious. All such resources contribute to the global warming, global warming needs to be solved urgently\n        by the active effort of each human being living on this planet henceforth, all the preventive measures should be taken to cover up the damage caused by\n        global warming, due to global warming the ozone layer got disturbed and the ultra violet rays are damaging the health pf people.', '\n        Global warming is the major threat around the world. Global warming means heating of earth by different gasses. Ozone layer plays a vital role protecting the\n        human kind from harmful radiations coming from the sun. Infrared radiations coming from the sun are very harmful and they can to lead to cancer. Skin\n        cancer is mainly effecting humans due to the damage of ozone layer. Chlorofluorocarbons releasing from the vehicles also leads damage of ozone layer.\n        Green house gases also plays a vital role in global warming. Scientists studies states that if the global warming rate increasing in this rate then some years\n        after low lying areas are effected by floods. Global warming should be controlled in order to sustain life on earth. Trees should be planted every where as a\n        counter measure for global warming. Global warming can be controlled by taking preventive methods. Oxygen rate should be increased in order to reduce\n        the gases which leads to global warming. Global warming mainly caused due the chlorofluorocarbons. Renewable sources should not be used as a fuel\n        because some gases releasing from these renewable sources are also a cause for global warming. The polar region acts as a mirror to reflect radiations\n        coming from sun. It is our responsibility to protect our earth and hence preventative methods should be taken in order to control the global warming. Global\n        warming cause carbon dioxide emission from fossil fuel burning power plants. Global warming can increase the green house effect due to the emission of\n        chlorofluorocarbons. Recycling methods should be used in order to reduce the wastage. In future if the global warming rate increases in this level the future\n        mankind cannot sustain life on earth. The humans are the major reason for global warming. Global warming should be controlled, so that our future\n        generations can sustain life on earth.', "\n        Yes, global warming is cause for concern because when temperature on earth increases then we cannot survive on earth. Global warming mainly occurs due to\n        deforestation, smoke coming from vehicles. Due to smoke produced by motor vehicles the ozone layer is damaging when ozone layer damages then UV rays\n        coming from sun will directly falls on the earth and people. When UV rays directly falls on human body then it leads to more diseases. When deforestation\n        increases then number of trees on earth will be decreases if there is less number of tress on earth then the rays coming from sun will directly falls on earth\n        then the temperature on earth automatically increases. When temperature in inside of the earth increases then it leads to blowing of lava from volcano. When\n        lava falls on trees or humans then the life of a human or tree will be decreases. Not only gases released by the motor vehicles also harmful gases released by\n        the industries leads to global warming. Most common harmful gases are CFC's, Carbon dioxide and soon. Global warming leads to acid rains, and temperature\n        changes in atmosphere. By applying some principles on transportation and industries we can decrease the global warming. The principles are like sharing\n        vehicles among people who are living in same colonies and working in same offices, industries must built in outskirts of town and the quality of fuel used by\n        the industries or vehicles must be good. If the principles mentioned above are followed by the humans then they can save wastage of fuel and also they can\n        save earth. Humans have no chance to cut trees in forestation because if trees are not there then there is no fresh air for us. If we breathes polluted air then\n        the life of us will decreases. Global warming also leads to earthquakes.", '\n        Global warming is one of the burning issue entire the world and preventive measures against this demon activity should be immediately taken care if we\n        neglect this matter then the next generation and our off springs should migrate to other planets, I am saying this because as the temperature of earth is\n        increasing day by day it will be difficult to survive on this planet, now it is time that all the people need to be turned altruistic in nature. Particularly awareness\n        needs to be created between all sections of the society, as unity is strength and every thing can be achieved through unity.\n        Global warming is mainly created due to deforestation and emission , radiation of ultraviolet rays, these are reaching the upper surface of earth, because of\n        the damage caused to ozone layer as some sort of carbons are reaching the stratosphere and effecting the ozone layer, due to the advancement in\n        technology the level of pollution and carbon dioxide is continuously increasing, for example the electronic devices used in our houses like refrigerators, air\n        conditioners, micro ovens and many more are causing adverse effects on the lives of human beings. They are becoming a ban instead of a boon since these\n        devices not only making the generation lazy but also entering into the life cycle of human being and disturbing it and making the use of these substances is\n        an incorrigible mistake done by the people.\n        The remedial measures of this is afforestation, reducing the use of devices that emit carbon dioxide and not allowing the animals to graze at the same place\n        daily, using the products that can be re used, avoiding complete use of plastic products, encouraging judicious use of renewable resources and not allowing\n        them to convert into nonrenewable sources. Everyone should make use of public transportation instead of using their private means of system.If most of the\n        people are philanthropist then this problem may not occur but the scenario is entirely different as most of the people are misanthropist and egocentric they\n        do not take care of the environm', '\n        Global warming one of the problems we are facing in the world nowadays, it is mainly due to human activities. Global warming is mainly due the release of\n        harmful chemicals into the air, because of the global warming ozone layer is affected. The effect of global warming is seen nowadays due to it harmful\n        chemicals from the sun are directly reaching the earth and it has a lot of effect on human beings. The effect of global warming is it causes sunstroke and skin\n        cancers. Nowadays we see that temperature is increasing day by day, and rainfall is decreasing due to it. The effect of global warming mainly on the\n        environment and human health due to this humans are affected by a lot of diseases. The global warming is increasing d ay by day, the changes in the climatic\n        conditions are changing a lot due to global warming. The cause of global warming is mainly due to human activities due to these activities global warming is\n        increasing. The government is taking some measurements to reduce global warming not only by government but also we ourself has to take measures to\n        reduce global warming, we are living in this environment so it is our responsibility of us to take care of our environment. Global warming not decreasing it is\n        increasing day by day, so possible to take as many measures as possible to save our environment. Its is each and everyone responsibility to take measures to\n        take care of our environment. Protect your environment and make it safe for your next generation.', "\n        Today's topic is about whether global warming is cause for concern. Global warming is heating of Earth's surface due to increased level in carbon dioxide.\n        Global warming leads to threats, which may lead to many diseases. This is mainly caused due to pollution from several factories and all. We generally know as\n        population is increasing day by day simultaneously factories are also increasing with them. Some fields are destroyed in order to construct factories, these\n        factories may provide employment for several people, but leads to afforestation, which decreases oxygen level in the atmosphere. We know that, there are\n        some holes on atmosphere, by which ultraviolet rays are directly falling on to the Earth's surface which leads to various effects. Global warming causes soil\n        erosion which leads to huge losses . Generally automobiles are also increasing pollution, which causes various effects to atmosphere. Global warming causes\n        droughts, floods and cyclones. As temperature is increasing day by day, dangerous effects will also increase along with it. Human beings are the main reason\n        for global warming. Nowadays no one minds about the climatic conditions, they simply think about their selfish things. One needs responsibility about the\n        society around him. He or she must think of future generation. Recent surveys proved that global warming is the main cause for environmental effects.\n        Recently Delhi adopted new method for transportation, that means the vehicle with odd sum will be used for one day and others must use the other day. This\n        is really a good idea by the government of Delhi. In order to protect ourselves from global warming all countries must and should take several measures to\n        control pollution.There are several measures to prevent global warming. If there is start up factory, there must be rules like to grow plants around their\n        company. Generally there are some companies which directly send their waste in canals, this must be avoided, which may lead to several effects in agricultural\n        sector. There may be some rules, but these are not strictly followed by the factories and whatever it may be. Government must pass rules in order to protect\n        us from global warming. We should be aware of global warming, in order to protect ourselves from dangers.", "\n        Global warming means the increase of earth's average surface temperature due to the emission of green house gases like methane, carbon dioxide and so on.\n        The causes of global warming are deforestation, increase in number of vehicles, industries and usage of plastic. Due to deforestation emission of carbon\n        dioxide into atmosphere is increased. Increase in number of industries causes air pollution, water pollution. Industries release wastes into rivers and lakes\n        causes water pollution. Industries release harmful gases into the air which causes air pollution.\n        Ozone layer will get depleted due to the global warming.

We should use\n        bicycles instead of bikes and cars. We should use the things which can be recycled", '\n        Global warming is gradually heating earth surface, oceans and atmosphere. Global warming effects humans in many ways. Firstly it begins with green house\n        effect, which is caused by the interaction of earth atmosphere and incoming radiation from the sun rays. The atmospheric gases mainly responsible for green\n        house effect are known as green house gases. They include water vapour, carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. The effects of global warming are\n        already visible in many places of world. Global warming is related to climate and is a global phenomenon. The global temperature has raise into fourteen\n        fahrenheit. Temperature changes is main occurrence of global warming. Pollution is also one of the main cause for global warming. Regional effects of global\n        warming vary in nature. The human influence in the climate can be seen in the geographical pattern of observe warming, with greater temperature increases\n        over land and in polar regions rather than over the oceans. Human beings are exposed to climate change through changing whether patterns and indirectly\n        through changes in water, food, and air changes in ecosystem. "WHO" world health organisation estimated the effects of climate change on human health.\n        Global warming is caused by the pollution in the atmosphere due to vehicles. The gases from solar radiations are absorbed by the atmospheric gases in the\n        earth surface. Some of the effects due to global warming are earth quakes, floods, tsunamis. Droughts have been occurring more frequently because of global\n        warming and they are expected', "\n        The rise in earth's surface temperature as a consequence of green house effect is called global warming. The thickening of earth atmosphere because of\n        presence of increased carbon dioxide and other green house gases is called green house effect. There are many effects to cause global warming.\n        Deforestration and industrial emissions to result to an increase green house gases around earth's atmosphere. These green house gases traps and absorbs\n        atmospheric heat and ultimately causes global warming. Global warming is causing climate change.The world's becoming warmer and warmer. There is also\n        prediction of regional climate changes along the ecosystem. One major consequence of global warming arising out of green house effect is the sea level. Four\n        major changes take place priority. Thermal expansion, mountain glacier meeting, ice sheet melting. Thus, the coastal cities and ports may be submerged\n        under sea water. Many islands may vanish from the earth suface as well as from the world map. The government should governs pollution and green house\n        gases. We can save paper by keeping documents in electronic paperand not by printing emails. Trees absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen. Trees helpful\n        in reducing the problem of global warming. We can share our car while going to office or performing other scheduled activities. On one hand, we will save\n        money and on other, we will emit less green house gases. A solution is to use less energy and to recycle more products. In conclusion, if we make small\n        changes now in the may we live, we can avoid huge changes in the future. Scientists, government and individuals must work together to overcome this threat.\n        Generating electricity is one of the main sources of carbon dioxide. If we use less electricity, we will produce less carbon dioxide.", "\n        Today's topic is about whether global warming is a cause for concern. The rise in earth's surface temperature is due to the increase in green house effect.\n        Green house effect is due to increase in gases like carbon dioxide and carbon mono oxide. The depletion of ozone layer is the major cause for global\n        warming. It causes the change in climatic conditions and proper rainfall. The sea level increases due to this green house effect. Due to rapid increase in\n        population and industrialization, the need for human is increasing. In order to fulfill the needs of a human, they are over utilizing the natural resources. We\n        should take care of our natural resources by proper utilization. The temperature of the earth is increasing in a huge manner. Due to this green house effect, a\n        lot of pollution is increasing. Atmospheric condition is changing and causes an air pollution. The major cause for this change in condition is deforestation. The\n        rapid increase in deforestation is the main cause for carbon dioxide. The increase in carbon dioxide level in the atmosphere leads to many disadvantages. The\n        major disadvantage is, it will effect the proper rainfall. Government should encourage the people to grow trees in a large extent. Trees will help our lives by\n        absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen to us. Rapid increase in industrialization causes the releasing in harmful gases. The health conditions of\n        people are effected due to this climatic changes. However, harmful gases are releasing from house hold appliances like air conditioners, refrigerators, etc.,\n        with this harmful gases oxygen levels are decreasing in the atmosphere. Everyone should think about our environment and should take actions to protect it.\n        People should reduce the usage of motor vehicles which reduces the half of the effects caused by the global warming. So, finally I conclude that protect\n        environment by using environmental friendly vehicles.", "\n        In present scenario Global warming has become a world's hazardous problem. Every one should concern a lot about global warming as, it affects our\n        environment badly. Due to global warming our earth's temperature raises and it leads to melting of ice bergs which lead to floods and evaporation of\n        moisture in soil which lead to malnutrition. The main cause for global warming is ozone layer depletion and effect of green house gases. The depletion of\n        ozone layer leads to penetration of IR rays which raises the earth temperature badly. The green house gases like carbon dioxide, nitrogen, carbon monoxide,\n        methane are the main cause for the depletion of ozone layer.\n        As global warming is a concern problem there are necessary measure are to be taken to decrease the earth's temperature. Scientist have done a lots of\n        surveys to decrease the global warming and stated that other causes for global warming are deforestation, excessive emission of green houses gases and\n        pollution. So, these effects badly increases the global warming.\n        The measures to be taken to decrease the global warming are afforestation, decrease of pollution, new ways for energy generation, and decreasing the\n        emission of green hou", '\n        Today\'s my topi is about "Global warming a cause for concern". Global warming is the increase of Earth\'s average surface temperature due to effort of\n        greenhouses gases. Global warming is the team used to describe a gradual increase in the average temperature of the Earth\'s atmosphere and it\'s oceans, a\n        change that is believed to changing the Earth\'s climate. There is great disable among many people, and sometime in the news, on weather global warming is\n        real. But climate scientists looking at the date and facts agree the planet is warning. While many view the effort of global warming to be more substantial and\n        more rapidly occurring than others do, the scientific on climate changes related to global warming is that the average temperature of the earth risen slightly\n        over the past 110 years. The increased volumes the carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases released by the burning of fuels, land cleaning, agriculture,\n        and other human activities.\n        Global warming occurs mainly by the use of dangerous gases which are released into the environment. By releasing this gases into the atmosphere the\n        environment is damaged. The people are facing the many problems by breathing these gases. The deforestation and industrial and emission are the main\n        cause of the global warming.By the cutting trees in the forest the land side is increased and the animals are number of decreases. The government should\n        take strict act at man power on forests. And the other global warming is greenhouses gases which are released by the industries are vehicles. The gases which\n        are releasing by these many environment so high. The main gases are carbon monoxide which is released by the vehicles and carbon dioxide by these\n        industries. Recently the national green tribunal has banned the vehicles which exides more than 2000 cc.', "\n        Today's topic is about is the global warming a cause for concern. Yes, nowadays greater number of people are pollute the environment. Greater number of\n        people are used plastics and also melting the plastics, because of this the environment is fully polluted. In earlier days there is a less number of factories,\n        because of this environment is less polluted. However, coming to modern days there are greater number of factories. These factories are released very\n        dangerous harmful gases. The global warming is mainly due to deforestation. In modern days the population is increased due to this deforestation takes\n        place. Global warming is already having significant and harmful affects on our communities, our health, and our climate. Dangerous heat waves are becoming\n        more common. From the global warming affect there are many problems like accelerating sea level rise, longer and more damages wild fire seasons, flooding.\n        The main problem due to global warming is the very dangerous rays are fall on to the earth, because of this very dangerous rays greater number of people on\n        the suffer from the skin cancer's. Nowadays, the rainy seasons are also changed, because of the global warming. Nowadays, greater number of people are use\n        mobile phones. These mobile phones are released more radiation, this radiation is also affects the environment. Flooding is increased, due to global warming.\n        From global warming, the heat waves are produced, these heat ways forests are burned. I can conclude that nowadays greater number people are plant the", '\n        Global warming means heating of earth. When the sun rays touch the earth, some of them are absorbed and some are reflected. The reflected rays enter into\n        the atmosphere, and the carbon dioxide and other green house gases lead to global warming. They will reflect those rays back to the earth, which are the\n        reason for heating up of earth.\n        With out global warming, life on earth is not possible. The earth would have frozen up without global warming, because the water on the earth will be in\n        frozen state and there will be no sign of life. We know that water is the main reason for the life on earth. Therefore, water should be in liquid state in order to\n        sustain life on earth. Global warming is the main cause to melt the water on the earth.\n        On the other hand, global warming has its own disadvantages. We have to take it as a concern, because of the over heating all the glaciers and ice is being\n        melted. This may lead to floods and scarcity of fresh water, because that water is going to mix in seas and oceans which is a wastage. Global warming has\n        another major disadvantage that is, depletion of ozone layer. Ozone layer is a layer of gas which protects the earth from harmful ultra violet rays. When the\n        green house gases reach the ozone layer, they react with the layer and depletes it. The ultraviolet rays can easily enter the earth and they will affect the life on\n        earth. The fresh water will be reduced due to global warming, which may lead to scarcity of water.\n        Therefore, we can conclude that, global warming should be taken to concern and preventive measures should be taken to reduce the green house gases. The\n        major preventive measures are afforestation and using natural gas as fuel.', '\n        Global warming is the harmful effect on our planet from years. Due to the industrial revolution and change in human habits also effect the environment. Rapid\n        growth in population also effects the environment and it causes global warming,Industrial growth in urban areas also increasing the pollution so,to avoid\n        global warming we have to plant the tress more. Deforestation also one of the reason for global warming. We are cutting the trees to build the houses and\n        industries, the ecological balance also disturbing by this actions to reduce the global warming we have to change our living the plant the trees. We are using\n        motor bikes and cars for transporting it results in air pollution, by this pollution the ozone layer is damaging day by day. Industries are exhausting gases and\n        waste in to the river and air it damages the environment. Nowadays natural calamities are occurring more, it is because of the global warming and also the\n        temperature on earth also increasing day by day. At present whole world is discussing about the global warming. Due to the global warming ice caps are\n        melting in polar region, because of it sea level is increasing and aquatic life is disturbing it results in ecological unbalance in environment. Finally I want to say\n        one thing that is plant more trees and improve the ecological balance it reduces the global warming and also reduces the temperature on earth.', '\n        Today my topic is about Is global warming a cause for concern? In my point of view, One of the biggest problems that today world facing is global warming.\n        Many scientists believe that cause of global warming is that reason of releasing the carbon dioxide and greenhouse gases and usage of plastics. Scientists are\n        the one who has to tell to the world in a practical manner that how we people are effected for global warming.The main reason for cause of global warming is\n        deforestation of tress and if we plant the tress then their will be decrease in global warming. When the sun rays are falls on the earth some of the rays are\n        enters into the earth and some of them are reflected towards the atmosphere. The main reason of effecting the global warming is that raise in sea falls due to\n        this the coastal areas and some of the poor countries who are effected near to the seas. To decrease the global warming every human being in the world\n        should plant a tree. If we plant the main advantage is plants absorbs the carbon dioxide and releases the oxygen which is very helpful to the human beings\n        and to the wold itself.\n        Governments should have to take care about the global warming and should has to protect the human beings in the world not only the governments sectors\n        but also the public should has to take care about themselves in case of global warming. In my point of view, industries like oil, petrol, and plastics are the main\n        reason for the effect of global warming because they releases more carbon dioxide into the earth and public are the one who uses more plastics in the work\n        purpose and after completing their work they simply throws out the plastic into earth which is the main reason for causing of the global warming.\n        I want to conclude that every one should be responsible in their life to decrease the global warming.', "\n        In my point of view global warming is a cause for concern. The global warming is due to the pollution. Nowadays people use more plastic when compare to\n        the olden days. The global warming is due the emission of unwanted gases. Acid rains occur due to the global warming. People should plant trees hence,\n        global warming can be reduced. In my point of view people are not interested in planting trees. Rising of sea level causes global warming.\n        Deforestation and industrial emissions result to an increase greenhouse gases around earth's surface. One of the biggest problem facing the world today is\n        global warming. Carbon dioxide is the gas which results to global warming. Rising of sea level result in the flooding of low lying coastal areas and cities.\n        Generating electricity is one of the main sources of carbon dioxide. In my point of view people should use less electricity and hence, we can reduce global\n        warming. At present government is interesting to plant more trees in our country and hence it lead to reduce global warming. People should come forward\n        and plant the trees because, trees give more oxygen and it helps in reducing global warming. Cutting trees and emission of poisonous gases lead to global\n        warming. People should protect the environment. Rising of sea level leads to the death of many people. The climatic conditions also changes every day due\n        global warming and environmental changes. Government should focus on reducing pollution causes due to poisonous gases like carbon dioxide. Many of the\n        people are uneducated and hence, they do not know the causes of global warming. Everyone should plant at least one tree to reduce the global warming. In\n        my point of view global warming can be reduce", '\n        Yes, global warming is a cause for concern because of the radiations from the Sun and the harmful pollution caused by vehicles. Nowadays, the vehicles are\n        increasing widely due to this the pollution also increases and causes global warming. Not only the vehicles the home appliances also causes global warming.\n        The pollution is also increasing due this the radiation increasing and nature is so affected by the people so that global warming is a cause for concern. The\n        ozone layer is affected more and causes more radiation due to this the global warming is cause for concern. Sometimes the people are also cause for global\n        warming a cause for concern because their industries which causes more radiations and pollution to the nature and more effect to the people. Global\n        warming is increasing more due to this non‐degradable waste which are more effect to the nature and it causes more affect to the environment. In present life\n        the global warming is more dangerous because the increasing of population and pollution caused by the people and their things so the things are gong now\n        should be stopped otherwise the future generations will face a problem in the future and they will have more effects and diseases.The main thing which we\n        should do at present is we have to control the global warming by taking some steps like plantation of plants and reducing the pollution caused by the\n        vehicles. Therefore the global warming can be decreased and it cannot be a cause of concern. Not only that the industries which causes more radiation and\n        pollution should take preventive methods to decrease the radiation the pollution. The Government should take initiative to reduce the global warming and\n        should take preventive measures to decrease the global warming. the thing that we have to be responsible is we have to save our nature for our future\n        generations.', "\n        According to me global warming is a cause for all the destruction happening all over the world. We have to be concerned about this issue and moreover we\n        should react to this situation. Global warming means the increase in the content of carbon‐dioxide and it also means the increase in the content of nitrogen.\n        When there is a increase in the amount of carbon‐dioxide and nitrogen there will be an decrease in the amount of oxygen. Humans cannot live with out\n        oxygen and they will be at risk if this issue is prolonged. Scientists say that there is an increase in the level of chloro‐carbons in the atmosphere and nitrogen\n        has also increased in high levels. The main cause for global warming is air pollution and it has to be reduced in a large extent. We can say in the 20‐century\n        there is a large improvement in the development of the industries all over the world and this is the primary cause for air pollution. There is an increase in the\n        level of water in Antarctica due to the melting of glaciers. If this scenario continues there is going to be a great loss for the mankind. Government has taken\n        several measures to control global warming, but it was unsuccessful in implementing the actions. There is a strong antipathy regarding this issue all over\n        world and all the nations are trying to halt global warming.\n        The effects of global warming are inadequate rainfall, increasing temperature levels, skin diseases, lung cancer, changes in the temperatures, change in\n        seasons and so on. The Government's ideas are feckless and ineffective. People should be aware of global warming and they should learn the preventive\n        measures. They should help the Government in solving this issue and try to sort out the problems that are prevailing in the world.", "\n        In my opinion global warming is a cause for concern. Global warming is caused by the pollution in the atmosphere. Pollution of atmosphere is caused in many\n        ways such as pollution of water and pollution of air. Global warming have several effect on human beings. It effects the temperature to increase on the earth\n        surface. Human beings are responsible for the increase in the global warming. Factories and industries set up by the human beings are exhausting harmful\n        gases into atmosphere, These gases causes air pollution. Increase in air pollution causes depletion of ozone layer. The ozone layer which protects us from the\n        harmful ultraviolet rays is being depleted, and result in global warming.\n        There are several effects due to global warming, it result in increasing the temperature of the earth's surface. Global warming also result in change in the\n        genes of human beings. Due to global warming, water in the oceans, lakes and rivers are getting evaporated. If this global warming increases to a great\n        extent, water in the whole world gets evaporated and all human beings fall under water crises. Government should take certain measures to reduce global\n        warming. Every individual should be aware of global warming and what are the effects on us due to global warming.\n        The major factories and industries which causes more pollution should be stopped by the government. Every factory and industry should take good measures\n        to reduce pollution by implementing new technologies.", '\n        The present topic is about global warming is concern or not. In my point of view global warming causes many problems to humans, plants, animals, and other\n        living things. Global warming is increased due to carbon dioxide and also other chemicals. It causes many problems to humans. Nowadays global warming is\n        the big problem for us to live a healthy life. If the global warming level is low then we can live good and healthy life. People need to know the effect of global\n        warming and better try to avoid things which cause global warming. So many people are using plastic very much this may lead to cause a global warming. So\n        people in the society better to get an idea about how to control global warming. Excessive usage of motor cycles, cars,refrigerators can lead to air pollution so\n        we have to better reduce usage of these things for protect environment. The big reason for global warming is deforestation. If we want to kill global warming\n        we need to do planting so that we can throw this problem away. Everyone should know about how to protect our environment so people need to work for it.\n        Global warming destroy the human life it may cause skin cancer. So many people are afraid for this global warming. The government should create awareness\n        about elimination of global warming and implements some mechanisms to control global warming. It is not only the task of government the people also fight\n        against global warming. The effect of global warming is heavy nowadays because of usage of plastic and some chemicals which may cause global warming.', "\n        Today the topic is about, is global warming a cause for concern? Global warming is the term used to describing the gradual increase in the average\n        temperature of the earth's atmosphere. The gradual increase of the green house gases like oxygen and carbon dioxide. The gases from industries are like\n        nitrogen and other gases are effecting the atmosphere. Transportation is also one of the reason in increasing the pollution. Most of the reason is that, the\n        gases are from industries and vehicles. We have to protect our environment. Deforestation is also one of reason for global warming. Global warming occurs\n        when carbon dioxide and other pollutants collect in the atmosphere and absorbs sunlight and solar radiation.\n        Nowadays most of the gases that are from cities. The chloro flora gases from refrigerators. Many people are using refrigerators. Deforestation means cutting\n        the number of trees. Due to deforestation oxygen levels in the air is decreasing. Industries releases the it's waste into canals and air causes water pollution and\n        air pollution. Due to the global warming ozone layer get deflects which affects the earth's atmosphere. So, ultra violet rays are directly fall on the earth which\n        causes skin diseases and cancer.\n        Prevention of global warming includes increasing the number of trees that means afforestation should be done. Everyone should create awareness among the\n        people about the causes, effects and solutions for global warming. So, we should reduce usage of vehicles like bikes and cars instead we should use bicycles.\n        We should reduce the usage of plastic. We should use the resources which can bBy using these we can reduce the global warming.", '\n        One of the problems facing by the world is "Global Warming". Scientists said that our production of Carbon oxides and other green house gases such as\n        Helium, Nitrogen and other gases leads to global warming. During these years after the industrial revolution the number of industries and factories were\n        increased drastically which leads to the production of many harmful gases in large quantity. Due to global warming the heat of the earth increases which leads\n        to increase in the temperature values.The temperature levels in the Antarctic region results in the melting of the ice glaciers, therefore the sea level increases\n        which is a problem. The home appliances such as air conditioners, fridges and so on. which are using the chloro carbons as the cooling agents, those are very\n        harmful to the environment, they plays a major role in the process of global warming. Due to rockets and aeroplanes the Ozone layer gets effected which\n        makes the ultra violet rays fall directly on the Earth, which effect the mankind. The damage of the Ozone layer is rectified to some extent, but it is not\n        completely done.\n        Global warming effects the mankind in many ways such as, it is responsible for in adequate rainfall, skin diseases, many cities are vanishing from world due to\n        the excess rise in the sea level. It also effects the monuments, let us take Tajmahal, its colour and shining is being effected by global warming. The\n        governments of all nations should take this issue very seriously and should take preventive measures to control global warming. Global warming can be\n        greatly controlled by the trees, so to reduce the effect of global warming large number of trees must be planted. People must have awareness about this\n        serious issue and should take preventive measures at their home and their surroundings.', '\n        In my point of view, global warming is definetely a cause for concern. There is good evidence that global temperatures have been slowly climbing for the past\n        four centuries and were slowly declining for many centuries according to that. But are these dangerous to our human life or is it a normal phenomenon? Sdly\n        our lifes are in danger if this global warming causes a threat our lives. We should be concerned about these affects and care of our lives.\n        Heat waves, droughts, wildfires, floods are now more frequent and more intense. Many of the common issues related to climate change are raised. We have\n        seen a lot of disasters and wild things happened in the recent days. Earthquakes, cyclones are the most danger things happened recently. They are indicating\n        us something that we should be careful of our lives. The climate has been changing. From this i could say that global warming is a cause for concern.\n        The main cause of global warming is human beings careless activities. As population is increasing, they are demanding land to live, crop cultivation that\n        causes to cut the forests leading to global warming. Burning of fossil fuels is one the most cause in increasing global warming. Continuously they are wasting\n        the natural resources and polluting the air, water and soil. Increasing inventions of the technology such as refrigerator, air conditioner, automobiles, electric\n        machines ultimately contribute to increase in the global warming. All these activities cause harm to the human life. So, we should be concerned about these\n        affects and care of controlling the global warming. We should reduce using of the devices that gives radiation resulting in the global warming. Even they are\n        useful in our daily life, we should know our self that we are damaging our life by ourselves.', "\n        Global warming is a big environmental and social issue all over the world which everyone must know especially our kids and children as they are future.\n        Scientists and economists of many countries are working regularly in the field of global warming from many decades in order to figure out causes, effects,\n        prevention's measures and solutions of it. In the last of few decades , a huge level of change in the climate and weather has been seen clearly. It has disturbed\n        the natural cycles and ecological balance in the atmosphere. The most important cause of increasing global warming is the effect of greenhouse gases which\n        are emitted by human activities. In order to work together and solve this issue by the global effort there is a group of scientists formed by the united nations.\n        This group works together to research the various causes, dangerous effects, effective prevention measures, and effective solutions.\n        According to the research and report of various highly skilled scientists, it is noted that ever increasing level of several greenhouse gases are highly\n        responsible for warming of atmosphere. Combustion of fossil fuels by various means such as automobiles, cars, factories, electricity use, etc are responsible\n        for emitting various greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, gases of nitrogen, etc. Other contributors of greenhouse effect are methane, nitrous oxide from\n        various toxic fertilizers, gases released by means of refrigeration and industrial processes, loss of forests, etc. The release of various toxic greenhouse gases in\n        the atmosphere is increasing the atmospheric temperature as they have heat trapping abilities. Methane gas molecules have more abilities to trap heat than\n        carbon dioxide. In many countries the use of chlorofluorocarbons has been banned because they have ability to degrade the ozone layer as well as high\n        potential to trap heat thousands of times more than carbon dioxide. The other cause of global warming is deforestation.", '\n        Yes, global warming is a cause for concern because today we are living in a polluted environment which leads to cause for human health.\n        Global warming is one of the major problem in these days facing by world. Main reasons for cause of global warming is excess of carbon from motor bikes,\n        aeroplanes and jets. Humans are busy in improving technology and habituated to spoon feeding. For example, In earlier days humans used to walk to reach\n        their destination. They never bother about transportation medium. In this modern world we using high end motor bikes and cars which are releasing high\n        amount of carbons into environment that lead to global warming. Effect of global warming are ozone layer get damaged, loss of soil fertility etc. If ozone layer\n        get damaged then sun rays fall on the earth directly that leads to skin diseases for humans, animals and plants. If plants are affected then there is no food\n        source for animals and humans. One of the major cause for global warming is deforestation. People without knowing any knowledge to develop their\n        construction and buildings cutting trees and destroying forest. Plants are best source to reduce pollution in environment because plants absorb carbon\n        dioxide that is released from humans, motor bikes, cars and aeroplanes etc.To reduce global warming people need to plant trees in society and to reduce\n        excess release of carbon dioxide into environment. Educated people should motivate people about global warming reasons for cause of global warming.\n        What have done upto now is enough but from now we should take prevention steps to reduce pollution in environment. High use electricity also leads to\n        global warming. Global warming not only affecting environment but also directly creating bad cause for human beings health. To reduce global warming we\n        should reduce use of carbons and deforestation etc.', "\n        Today's topic is global warming is harmful or not. In my perspective, global is an important issues for today's generation. Global warming causes a big effect\n        on living beings. Global warming is formed because of air pollution, water pollution, noise pollution, sound pollution etc. The most important reason for\n        today's various of diseases is global warming. Not only diseases but also effect on plants. Plants and trees are the great responsible for living a healthy life. If\n        we did not take care about those things how can we survive a healthy life. Leading a healthy life is today's main motto. Health is wealth is the present trend\n        following our society. Not only for our's sake, it is our responsibility to take care of trees and plants. Global warming percentage is increasing by every year.\n        We must and should took a responsibility of taking care of trees and plants. It is our responsibility to protect our society and our life. Life is very precious and\n        small, in that small life every body think to live a happy life without any problems. Without taking care of all these things like plants and trees, how can we\n        survive a healthy life. Planting trees, decrease deforestation, increase afforestation, following these things must give a good result for global warming. If we\n        did not enhance even now, we cannot do anything for future generation. Keeping in mind for our future generation also to be survived in this society, so it is\n        our responsibility to take of our trees and pants. Surely global warming is a cause for concern, it must and should effect the present society and future world.\n        Making a particular plan for global warming precautions is the only way to safe ourselves. It is our main responsibility to save our life and our world. Global\n        warming is surely a cause for concern. Taking precautions from now is the only remedy for decrease the effects of global warming.", '\n        In my point of view, global warming cause a lot of effect to the environment. Because nowadays pollution is increasing due to the human activities. The main\n        cause is due to the industries, factories, and deforestation. The effect of the environment by increasing the green house gases like carbon dioxide, methane,\n        and nitrous oxide. The main thing about the global warming is that increasing of temperature in these it will change the climate nature.Atmosphere plays a\n        key role in the environment. Because the one thing is deforestation it cause due to the cutting of trees and plants. In this the human activities cause due to\n        releaising of house applicence gases into the environment. If we cut down the trees and forest it increase the cause on atmosphere. Secondly, carbon dioxide\n        tends to demand in the atmosphere for a very long time. Water vapor on the other hand, can easily condense or evaporate. The main reason for the depletion\n        of the ozone layer is pollution. Pollution is mainly caused due to the excessive use of vehicles, carbon dioxide causing agents like fridges, air conditioners and\n        many other things. Ozone layer should be protected in order to protect ourselves from global warming because ozone layer acts as a wall which protects us\n        from the harmful radiation of sun. Everyone should take some initiative to protect themselves from the global warming and they should come up with some\n        interactive ways which will reduce the impact of global warming. Plantation of tress, protection of forests and reducing the usage of vehicles will reduce the\n        impact of global warming. Usage of plastic, covers less than forty microns should be banned in order to reduce the global warming because plastic items\n        takes a lot of time for decomposition which will result in the increase of temperature and many other things. So, everyone should take some preventive\n        methods to reduce the impact of global warming.', '\n        Global warming means heating of earth. Sun emits energy in the form of light waves, which in turn fall on earth. meanwhile, many of the waves get reflected\n        back to the atmosphere. The green house gasses present in the atmosphere will send back those energy waves back to earth. This causes heating of earth,\n        which is called as global warming.\n        Sea level rise, more frequent and severe heat waves, growing wildfire risks,and an increase in extreme weather events and other consequences of global\n        warming were once largely preventable. We must take immediate actions to reduce our global warming emissions and prevent theses consequences from\n        growing more costly and severe in the future.\n        The cost and benefits of global warming will vary greatly from area to area. For moderate climate change, the balance can be difficult to assess. The crops,\n        natural vegetation and wild animals that sustain people in a given area may be unable t adapt to local or regional changes in climate. With out global\n        warming the earth would have frozen up and there would be no sign of life on the earth. The global warming melts the ice and provides major drinking water.\n        On the other hand, global warming is heating up the earth in such a way that it is drying up the water on the earth. Water is the natural resource, where as\n        only three percent of water is considered as fresh water and rest of the water is considered to be salt water. The increase of global warming has many bad\n        effects on the life of many animals and trees. The solution to control global warming is, by planting more and more trees, Using natural gas for household\n        purpose, reducing the green house gases by checking the vehicles regularly.\n        Therefore, we can conclude that global warming is a cause for concern.', "\n        Global warming is the continuous rise in warming of the earth's surface due to the increased level of carbon dioxide gas in the environment. Global warming\n        has become a big issue which need to be solved by the positive initiation of countries all over the world. As gradual increase in the earth temperature calls\n        various threats as well as makes the existence of life hard on this planet. It enhance the gradual and permanent changes in the earth's climate and thus\n        affecting the nature's balance. Rise in the carbon dioxide level on the earth impacts the human life to a great level through continued heat waves. The\n        increasing level of carbon dioxide causes greenhouse effect on the earth in which all the greenhouse methane, ozone absorbs thermal radiations, which in\n        turn re‐radiated to all directions and come back to earth surface causing increase in the temperature of the earth surface and lead to global warming. Global\n        warming causes carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel burning power plants, carbon dioxide emissions from burning gasoline for transportation, and\n        emission of methane from animals etc.Global warming effects on rise in sea level world wide, effects more killer storms,effects on massive crop failures. Many\n        awareness program and to reduce global warming have been run and implemented by the government agencies. Some of the damages through global\n        warming cannot be returned by the solution. However, we should not get back and try everyone's best to reduce the effects of global warming by the\n        reducing of the human causes of global warming. We should try to reduce emissions of green house gases to the atmosphere and adopt some climate\n        changes which are already happening for years. Instead of using electrical energy we should try using clean energy or energy produced by the solar system.\n        Reduce the level of coal and oil burning, use of transportation etc. may reduce the global warming.", "\n        Today's one of the main problems around the world is global warming. The causes of global warming are many like heavy release co2 gases and high\n        unwanted gases that are releasing around the world.

In my point of view, we have to concern for global warming. This is the main problem\n        facing humans and animals. Yes, we have to concern for this. This is the major problem facing all countries, which effects ozone layer. If ozone layer has\n        damaged, we have to face many problems. The sun rays are directly fall in to the earth which cause skin diseases, eye blindness and some other problems. we\n        have decrease the products that effects environment like plastic and non degradable substances. The factories and industries are directly releasing the waste\n        materials in to air and water. The government should take care about these type of issues. We have to plant trees to protect environment, which helps us from\n        global warming. Today the global warming become major issue, but the government not looking after these type of issues.\n        The gases that are using in fridges, air conditioners and coolers are cause more environment pollution and the smoke released from vehicles leads to air\n        pollution. The burning of plastic and the gas released from it leads to air pollution the industries are releasing dangerous chemicals into rivers and seas, which\n        leads to water pollution. The living age of human life decreases due to this pollution and global warming. We have to be responsible for our activities that we\n        are doing, which spoils environment.\n        The planting of trees helps us to decrease pollution due to these trees rains will fall in a particular time by increasing factories and the chemicals and gases\n        released by them leads to acid rains and earth quakes. We have to be concern for all these type of activities that has been done by human. Everyone should\n        take some initiative to reduce the impact of global warming.', "\n        Global warming is due to man's actions done for the welfare of his selfish needs. There are many factors, which are responsible for such a destructive task,\n        which leads annihilation of complete universe without a trace of life on earth. We cannot completely state that global warming is a cause for concern because\n        it started before identifying the results of performing such harmful functions which unknowingly lead to a evolved factor called global warming. It is primarily\n        due to the use of various harmful gases in the production and daily of usage of electronic goods like fridges and air conditioners to live a luxurious life,\n        releasing harmful and tedious gases into our environment and leading to the appreciation of earth's temperature and causing other dreadful diseases to\n        homo sapiens. Moreover, now it has really become a concerned component because we humans now have realized the effects of undertaking such morbid\n        functionalities which further converts earth into a barren land. In addition to that, depletion of ozone layer is another key element for this unhealthy action\n        because of depletion of that protective covering multiple number of poisonous rays are reaching our planet and causing many skin infections and\n        unidentified tumors as well sometimes also leading to cancer.

Many scientists assume that our production of carbon dioxide and other green house gases\n        are having a heating a heating effect on the environment, and this could be very dangerous for human life.\n        One of the biggest problem is raising sea level. This could lead to flooding of low‐lying coastal areas and cities, such as Egypt, the Netherlands. Some\n        countries might even disappear altogether! The other problem caused byglobal warming is changes in weather. Many areas of the world are feeling increased\n        floods and another unusual climate. The third issue is how the global warming is affecting, while some insects which spread disease might become more\n        common.\n        They are many things to solve this kind of problems. One solution is to stop usage of co2. Another solution is to plant more trees. Trees absorb carbon\n        dioxide and produce oxygen, which is not a green house gases. The effect over the global side is very unique, like the climatic changes which is very heated up\n        so that every water pond will gets evaporate and become as thick gases which will goes up into the air and it is a light in weight so that it goes into the upper\n        layers. In order to reduce their usage of co2, we need several steps to get into action. The green house gases are which have gone up are going eaten up the\n        ozone layer that will make the solar rays to fall up on the earths crust. This makes the earth heated up on cause to the global warming. If it continues like this\n        over future generations are surely will get effected.\n        In conclusion, if we make little changes in the way of our living, we can easily avoid big changes in future.', '\n        Yes, global warming a cause for concern. It became a major issue in our country. There are many problems in our climate of our homeland due to this reason.\n        Global warming is harmful to not only for human life, but also for animals and nature too. Global warming is caused due to the reason of mistakes and\n        carelessness of the human. Nowadays, there is a huge growth in technology. Along with technology, there are many things raising in our world like factories,\n        industries and many. These releases many harmful gases which disturbs the environment.\n        Our country is rich in agriculture. But, it is even rich in producing many harmful gases into atmosphere. Many problems could result from global warming. The\n        main reason of global warming is releasing carbon dioxide. This gas is being produced by many factories. These are destructing the nature. Many people are\n        involving in deforestation. Trees are good in consuming carbon dioxide. But, people are killing trees and decreasing the level of consuming of the harmful\n        gases, so every one must encourage forestation in order to decrease global warming in our country and in our our world too. The effects of global warming\n        are deforestation, decrease in rainfall, decrease in oxygen content in air, flooding, cyclones, tsunami and all. All of the above are huge effects to nature and to\n        human life. Every one need to grow plants in their houses in order to avoid these problems. Growing trees may again raise the rainfall. Nowadays, rainfall is\n        being decreased a lot than from previous years. The government must restrict the people to avoid factories which releasing harmful gases and must maintain\n        the trees and nature with love. These things can help in increasing the agricultural rate in our country. People can also use natural gas instead of other gases\n        for cooking purpose. These all above precautions can make our world beautiful and healthy.', '\n        Today\'s topic is about "Global Warming" is a cause for concern or not. Global Warming is the effect of increase of Earth\'s average temperature due to green\n        house gases. It plays a key role in deciding the atmospheric temperature, humidity in the atmosphere, pressure in the atmosphere. Global warming decides\n        the whole climatic system\'s position. For this reson hundred\'s of creatures, icebergs, along with human beings get effected. There are so many effects that\n        comes into existence due to the temperature rise in the atmosphere. Many of them causes dangerous effects to human beings like melting of icebergs, ice\n        mountains, etc, which gives rise to the increment in the sea water level. As pollution increases rapidly due to increase in population, rapid increase in vehicles,\n        rapid increasein emission of gases, rapid industraliasation, etc, tends toincreases the earth\'s average temperature leads to increasein global warming. The\n        main reasons for increasing global warming are mostly by changing land uses, rapid increase in industries due to the crude behaviour of human beings. The\n        main reason for increasing global warming is pollution, there by creating a hole to ozone layer. It may leads to the depletion of ozone layer, and acts as an\n        allowing medium for the harmful ultraviolet radiation from the sun. This may causes severe effects to human beings, crops, plantation in the earth. The\n        consequences of global warming are, it effects the human beings in a severe manner and destroys the plantation, crops and leads to death of some human\n        beings. In my opinion, the ways to reduce the global warming are, firstly increase the plantation, there by reducing the pollution levels. The second way to\n        reduce global warming is to decrease the amount of pollution by means of using renewable energy sources like solar energy, wind energy, tidal energy,\n        biomass energy, geothermal energy etc. The best way to reduce global warming is to keep the pollution in optional level.', '\n        Today, my topic is global warming a cause for concern. Global warming is the problem we facing now. Global warming means earth getting heat. Earth is\n        protecting by ozone layer this is helps us to stop the dangerous sunrises from sun. People making more pollution on earth it leads to ozone layer depletion.\n        We have to stop the pollution by factories and waste from that factories. The waste from the factories is mixing in water it leads to water pollution like wise\n        the factory people are polluting the air by releasing some harmful gases. Because of earth heating the people who living on earth are getting some health\n        problems. Global warming leads to acid rains and chlorofluorocarbons also affect the earth So, people should take care the earth. To resolve this problem we\n        should increase oxygen levels on earth and also by reducing the factories which are releasing harmful gases in addition to that we should decrease the use of\n        plastic. We should avoid the more usage of vehicles to reduce air pollution. So, people should have some awareness about how to take care of environment.\n        By doing all these things we can reduce pollution in air and we will defeat the problem of global warming.', "\n        Global warming is a big environmental and social issue all over the world which everyone must know. Our earth's surface becoming hot day by day by\n        trapping the sun's heat and rise in the level of atmospheric carbon dioxide. The bad effects of it increasing day by day and causing major problems to the\n        living of human being it has become one of the subjects of big social issues which need social awareness to a great level. People should know its meaning,\n        causes, effects and solutions to solve it immediately. Decreasing the number of plants on the earth leads to decrease in c. As plantsare the main source of\n        the using carbon dioxide released by the human being. Global warming has become the most worrying threat for the earth's atmosphere as it is reducing the\n        life possibilities on all the earth day by day. To reduce global warming people should stop producing carbon dioxide by stopping their bad habits such as,\n        stop the use of oil and coal and gas. People should grow trees to reduce global warming. Nowadays we are seeing deforestation. Deforestation is the also the\n        main cause of global warming. Global warming is also caused due to the dangerous gases produced by the factories. By reducing factories we can reduce\n        global warming. Global warming is caused by every people throughout the world due to some reasons. Every human should aware of global warming and try\n        to reduce global warming by planting the trees and reducing factories. The gas produced by vehicles also causes global warming. By reducing the usage of\n        vehicles we can reduce global warming. Global warming leads to many problems not only to human but also throughout the world. Everyone should aware of\n        global warming and try to reduce that by using some methods.", "\n        Today's discussion is about, should we concern about global warming, which is a major atmospheric problem. In my perspective, global warming should be\n        controlled, because this effect on the earth may leads to sudden extinction of human beings as well as animal species. Global warming is the term used to\n        define the earth's average atmospheric temperature, which is due to the effect of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, hydrogen, neon emissions by\n        either through man made calamities or through the act of deforestation.\n        Moreover, the major effect of global warming is, due to the emissions of greenhouse gases more into the environment and this causes the increase in the\n        earth's temperature tremendously. Even though, the percentage of carbon dioxide content in the atmosphere compared to other gases is low, the minute\n        increase in carbon dioxide shows the greater effect on the earth.\n        On the other hand, human should know the problems occur due to this effect and should know the importance of afforestation. Growing plants and trees, in\n        this environment may some what decrease this effect because trees are the one, which can absorb and decrease the temperature. The another major cause is\n        due to the burning of fossil fuels and plastics, that emits a high nuclear gases, which are very dangerous to the human kind. Government must take necessary\n        measures for preventing the downfall of forest area and to implement the tree cultivating programmes and the rural people should be educated in a\n        professional way to know the effects if global warming. Global warming is one of the major reason for the extincton of animal and", '\n        Global warming refers to the gradual change increased the atmosphere of earth, surface and oceans as a result of greenhouse gases .Carbon monoxides\n        emission created by deforestation and burning fossil fuels, these fossil fuels cause different types of effects to atmosphere of the earth. Fossil fuels create\n        more heat. Global warming causes because of the pollution, fossil fuels and deforestation. Emission of radiation of ultraviolet rays. Nowadays people are not\n        at all caring about the atmosphere, they are releasing carbon dioxide in to atmosphere it will causes global warming. In our daily life electrical motors are also\n        releases some hazardous substances thus affects to the ozone layer due to this sudden changes of occurs because of reduction of ozone layer can causes\n        some diseases like cancer skin diseases. deforestation takes main part on the global warming. Nowadays people cutting trees instead of growing trees can\n        cause global warming. Sudden changes in climate can occurs heavy rainfall.\n        The remedial measures of global warming is afforestation, not allowing animals to graze at the same place and not using the home appliances that emit a lot\n        of carbon dioxide because all these are the reasons for damaging of ozone layer and the effected damage layer cannot stop the radiation of dangerous gases\n        to reach the surface of the earth, these rays are creating a lot of dermatology problems to the living beings. This problem has arrived as most of the people\n        are misanthropist instead of being an altruist or philanthrop', "\n        Today's topic is about global warming a cause for concern or not. Global warming is the current issue faced by each and every person. Not only the person\n        but also the animals and plants. Global warming is due to the air pollution, water pollution and sound pollution. Nowadays global warming is the major\n        problem due to that our climatic conditions are changing rapidly. Global warming changes not only our climatic conditions but also damage the main\n        important ozone layer. Ozone layer protects the earth from harmful radiations which are released by sun. We must think about the rapid change of climatic\n        conditions. The climatic conditions are mainly changed because of human beings. We waste a lot of food, water, fuel and damage trees. Our selfish reasons\n        and cunning things are damaging the polar ice caps. We must behave like generous and help for growing of trees and plants. People always think about their\n        comfortable life and behave like ambidextrous for their selfish reasons. If the ozone layer is fully damaged due to global warming, people will face a lot of\n        difficulties in their future. Nowadays there are so many natural calamities are happening due to the rapid change of climate. There are so many natural\n        calamities recently happened. In Japan tsunami is the natural calamity frequently going to occur due to air pollution. People became unhealthy due to global\n        warming. People must think like generous and amicable for growing up of generation. If we are not use the resources in a proper way, they will maximum\n        create a dangerous problem coming to the next generation. Global warming badly effect on hills, polar ice cups and ozone layer.Global warming mainly effect\n        on our health. People must think in a creative way for solving those kind of problems. Global warming is the greatest problem faced by all living things. If we\n        grow the trees, it will breath the dangerous gases and release good gases which are neffected to humans.", "\n        Today my topic is global warming a cause for concern. In my point of view global warming is very dangerously affected to the environment. Nowadays, global\n        warming is increasing, at the same time the concern of the people is increases. The global warming is only increased by the surrounding pollution. Global\n        warming means to increase the heat of the earth. As a result of global warming is effected to the earth quakes. Nowadays the pollution of the environment is\n        increasing very highly. As a result of global warming some birds are completely spoiled. Some industries like factories is effected by the global warming\n        continuously. My idea about this topic is all the should follow the strict instructions are followed by the government. The government will give the strict\n        instructions to the public, then only we decrease the global warming. As a result of global warming the ozone layer is depleted. Once the ozone layer is\n        depleted, the effect of the sun rise is increases. The main aim of the topic is about global warming all the people must follow the plantation. The plantation is\n        only reason to decrease the global warming. The effect of global warming, the drinking water should be spoiled. For example, ozone layer is depleted the\n        dangerous radiations is damage the people's skin. The harmful radiations are coming to the sun is directly fall on the earth, it causes skin cancers. The main\n        motto of the line is is the cause for concern to the people because, the people should effected by the harmful radiations. Finally, to decrease the global\n        warming by the increasing plantation.", '\n        There are many factors which effects the earth. People do not think about the future they just use the resources of earth. Many people uses plastic covers\n        instead of polythene covers. Polythene covers dissolve in soil, whereas plastic covers are not dissolve in soil. For that reason our earth contains more pollution.\n        Some people who are thinking about our earth maintains some rules in order to save our earth.\n        Earth is also spoiled by our products which we are used in our daily life like refrigerator. It releases some gases which are very harmful to our health and earth.\n        One form of reducing pollution is to, increase the growth of trees that will take care of our earth. Earth contains 70 percent of water and rest is all rocks. We\n        are having good resources, but we are not using it and also damage the resources which we have. The main goal of government is to increase the growth of\n        plants and increase time span of human beings.\n        There are many ways of achieving the goal of government. One way is to checking whether the people are plant the trees and also provide the facility of\n        growing plants by giving seeds to the people. Some people have the habit of planting so, encourage those people in order to reduce the pollution.\n        Government should maintain some boards which give messages to people so, that everyone read the message what is written on it and try to change their\n        mode. What i am trying to tell is, those people who are belongs to that country should plant at least one plant. So in this way we can reduce the pollution.\n        Trees are friends of human beings. Trees always help and give more benefits to human beings. With the help of tress we get heavy rains. Some people treat\n        trees as god. They worship the tree with their beliefs whereas, some people treat the tree as their family member. The conclusion is we have to reduce the\n        causes which affects the earth so, that everyone can enjoy their life and there is a chance to tell to our future generation.', '\n        In this present topic, global warming is a cause presently all human begins are suffering a lot by this effect. Lot of amount of heat is increased by this effect of\n        global warming. In olden days, there the heat produced gets reflected due to the protection of ozone layer. The ultra violet rays that are produced gets\n        reflected by the protection of ozone layer. Presently we are using very harmful radiations that are emitted from the factories. Due to that harmful radiations\n        the ozone layer is getting thin and form small holes to that ozone layer. Due to that holes formed in the ozone layer the harmful ultra violet rays are entering\n        into that holes and the heat that is present in the ultra violet rays which are very harmful are affecting the human beings.Yes, these global warming is a cause\n        to all the living organisms in the world. And many of the people are very worried in this situation when their are suffering from this harmful rays so many of\n        them are concerned because this global warm is very harm and very dangerous to all the human beings in the world. And most of the people are cutting lot\n        of trees, forests and making their buildings to survive their lives. And this also one of the cause for the global warming. And we should not do like that, and\n        most of human begins are suffering a lot by doing like that cutting trees. In my point of view, most of the people are concerned about this global warming\n        and this is the universal problem that are suffering by the lot of living organisms', '\n        Today my topic is on is global warming a cause for concern? why or why not, in my point of view global warming is a serious prob;em faced by hole world\n        each and every nation is afraid of this global warming, while coming to India it is agriculture based country and due to global warming the major affect\n        caused to field so India is a country which faces major damage due to global warming because agriculture is the back bone for India in our country more than\n        sixty percentage of peoples are farmers, and not only our country other countries also face huge problems due to global warming for example country like\n        Iceland is facing a huge problem of increasing of sea level and decreasing of ice mountains, this problem was caused due to ultra violate rays from sun are\n        directly hitting the ground due to absence of ozone layer this ozone layer have damaged due to carbon gases released by humans, in this way global\n        warming leads to increasing of sea level and people used to through there company waste into the sea because of this organic waste many aquatic animals\n        are extending, sound pollution the sound released from the bikes trains and jets they contain high wave length it causes huge damage to human ear, another\n        problem faced by humans due to global warming is air pollution due to releasing of harmful gases into atmosphere leads to decrease of oxygen level and it is\n        difficult for humans to breath and leads to lung cancer.\n        I also say that global warming is to be taken seriously and must preventive measures like using jute bags and make sure that your bike has a pollution\n        checkup, every person but use a Eco friendly tools and Eco friendly electronic good. Finally, I conclude that very person in this society must consider global\n        warming is a serious issue and take preventive methods.', "\n        In my point of view, nowadays global warming is a very burning topic in the environment. I can concerned this type of disasters in the environment, at first\n        what is global warming? global worming is just rise the temperature with in the sun raised temperature. In so many reasons occurs in the pollution, pollution\n        is main cause of global worming and green house effect also, these two are effected ozone layer in the atmosphere.\n        Here, main thing is sun raises rays to earth, now earth is reflected some rays back but some rays are exhausted water, then few rays are reflected in that area,\n        here, average temperature in the earth, this temperature melt some ice burgs in the earth, after floods coming from the ice burg areas.\n        Earth is maintain the average temperature in between 0.4 C to 0.6 C in the environment. The main cause of global worming is gas diffusion's and fire house's\n        these are the main thing in the global worming. So many pollution in the environment like water pollution, air pollution and other pollution. Green house\n        effect is happening to diffusion gases and other bad smell gases.\n        This gas goes to top of atmosphere and get reflected by ozone layer reaches the earth again. Hence, the heat of earth increases heavily as a result the life of\n        trees on the it will decreases. The world has been occupied by oceans is more and hence we should use limited", "\n        Global warming is nothing but increase the Earth's surface temperature due to the effect of deforestation and warming or burning of fuels. Most of the global\n        warming take's place due to the burning of plastics. Which makes so many diseases occurred to human like breath cancer, skin cancer , lung cancer.\n        Another way increasing the global warming is deforestation. Deforestation makea us increased the Earth's temperature. Increasing the Carbon dioxide in\n        atmosphere is another cause. This Carbon dioxide increased due to mainly vehicles. Vehicles delivered highly Carbon dioxide mixed fog to the Earth's\n        temperature. Global warming effect is one the most harmful to us. Increasing temperature causes most dangerous diseases to the human along with animals.\n        To reduce the amount of Earth's surface every one should planet trees. We will how many trees are saved defenetly that effect on glablam warming, we will\n        saved forests, trees under the deforestation. However every one should personal take responsibility on the global warming. The government motivate to\n        people on globel warming. Take more measures like low burning fuel vehicles, stop deforestation and also low amount use of Air conditioners. Air\n        conditioners are the major role in the increasing of Earth's temperature. So to take's prevent actions and measure things to decrease the global warming.\n        Global warming effects on", '\n        Global warming is a major atmospheric issue all over the world.Global warming is a process in which the the temperature of the increases continuously. Global\n        warming causes increases day by day. The effects of Global warming effects the living of human being on earth. The temperature of the earth increase\n        gradually by the tapping of the sun and results in increase in atmospheric temperature. Global warming is an environment issue all over the world. Use of\n        refrigerators and air conditioners is one of the reasons behind Global warming. Global warming is the major social issue that the world is facing now.\n        Pollution, deforestation, grazing are the reasons due to which the Global warming increase.Global warming causes many affects to the living of human beings\n        on the earth. Technology is the main reason for the Global warming. Global warming is the major problem facing by the present generation. Global warming\n        leads to increase in earth temperature gradually. This increase in temperature results in diseases to the human beings.\n        Global warming is a major social issue that every one must know especially children and students as they are future. Global warming is nothing but the\n        increase in earth temperature gradually by the tapping of sun. Pollution from the motor vehicles like cars, trucks, motor bikes and buses is one of the reasons\n        for the Global warming. The gasses evolved from refrigerators, air conditioners, automobiles are the most harmful gasses which results in increase of earth\n        temperature. As the Global warming increase the earth temperature, due to this increase in temperature chemical reactions will take place which are harmfull\n        to the living of human being on the earth.', '\n        Today my topic is about "Global warming". Nowadays global warming place a crucial role in the present environment. Due to increasing in pollution it may\n        results to the global warming. The main cause of the increasing of the global warming is green house gases. The main green house gases are\n        chlorofluorocarbons. The chlorofluorocarbons are refrigerators it release very high amount of carbons. Due to this release the ozone layer gets damaged\n        which results to increasing in ultraviolet radiations. It results to causing many disease like skin cancer, heart problems. It can be over come by increasing in\n        trees. One of the first things scientist learned is that there several green house gases responsible for warming and humans emit them in variety of ways. Most\n        come from combustion of fossil fuels in cars, factories and electricity production. The gas responsible for the most warming is carbon dioxide.\n        Different green house gases have very different heat trapping abilities. Some of them can even trap more heat than carbon dioxide. In order to understand\n        the effect of all the gases together, scientists tend to talk about all green house gases in terms of the equivalent amount of carbon dioxide.\n        To bring all the information together, the United Nations formed a group of scientists called the Intergovernmental Panel on Climatic Change. The panel\n        meets every few years to review to latest scientific findings and a report summarizing all that known about global warming. In each report represents a\n        consensus, among hundreds of leading scientists.\n        To overcome this global warming, afforestation is required. Afforestation means growing of large number of trees which results to decreasing the global\n        warming. In my view, many harmful gases like chlorofluorocarbons, is the main cause of global warming. In my point view to control this global warming every\n        one has to take responsibility.', '\n        Global warming is a major cause to the environment. Nowadays it becomes major problem to environment and getting more polluted. There are many\n        problems for global warming. Some of them are coming smoke from industries, vehicles and so on. Today nature is polluted due to people who are using\n        polluted materials, fridges, vehicles. Due to the pollution, many agriculture products are getting polluted and we are eating that items. In world global\n        warming is the first and most problem to the earth. It leads to ozone layer depletion and health problems. All the countries are facing same problem and did\n        not take any safety measures to control global warming. In India some states are following some measures and doing services by cleaning the areas which are\n        not good. When ozone layer is affected then it have some holes.From sun some rays are coming to the earth and these rays are causes skin disease. If any\n        industry or vehicles release smoke it goes to space and becomes affecting ozone layer. Most of the environment is polluted by jet plains, air vehicles etc.,\n        causes warming of earth. But any country not follows safety measures and it getting more polluted. Global warming is heating earth and causes so many\n        problems to human beings, animals, plants. Nowadays technology also growing and global warming is increasing. Human beings are cutting trees so that\n        oxygen is not sufficient to them.', '\n        Today my topic is about global warming. It is a very important role in the present situation. Global warming may cause many health problems in the world.\n        Global warming may cause health diseases. Global warming mainly caused by due to lack of pollution. Global warming mainly in towns and cities. Planting\n        trees ton reduce global warming. The main important thing in global warming is vehicles and power projects. Global warming may can loss earth growth.\n        Global warming main effect according to the insufficient of greenery. Mainly implement the greenery to reduce global warming. The people should make\n        aware about planting tress. Global warming is main cause due to pollution. All the people in cities and villages should know about global warming effects. The\n        dangerous disease occur due to global warming. Cancer is also mainly cause by due to global warming. Government should implement many formulas to\n        implement global warming. Ozone layer is depleted by global warming. Radiation also more due to global warming. Global warming may cause may loss in\n        earth. Global warming is to stop by people and save earth. Due to global warming many animals,birds also effected by global warming. The main cause effect\n        of earth. There are more steps to implement against global warming. Towns and cities are main problem to create pollution. Global warming is the main cause\n        to depletion of ozone layer. Global warming is to reduce to make health people. Skin effects also cause by global warming. The nuclear weapons also cause\n        global warming. Growth of plants to reduce global warming. Global warming is to cause low rainfall. Finally, global warming cause many effects to people and\n        earth.', '\n        Global warming is the major problem that we are facing nowadays. The major cause for the global warming is the negligence of man\'s attitude about nature.\n        In every where we can see the affects which are causing to earth. In some cases we can consider the major cause is pollution. We can see nowadays how the\n        earth is being affected by a dangerous and poisonous gases. Especially, this can be seen in industrial areas because they are emitting the wastes in to the air\n        through chimneys. It is not the correct way because with this way the earth is being affected with global warming. The main reason for this is the excessive\n        amounts of pollution and the another main reason is deforestation.\n        We all know that the trees are cutting for the man\'s sake and to lead a happy life. In other scenario, we can see the emission of dangerous gases like nitrogen\n        and hydro carbons in to the atmosphere. Recently, the government has formed the committee that is "Intergovernmental Panel On Climate Change" is one of\n        the project launched. Due to overwhelming of these gases the earth is being affected a lot. When coming to another perspectives, the glaciers which are\n        present at the oceans. The global warming leads to the melting of that particular glaciers. This particular effects leads to the raising of sea levels with this the\n        natural disasters are coming. Due to global warming we are being affected by the tsunami and the excessive amounts of heat present in the earth. This is main\n        reason sometimes which may leads to the volcanic eruption. Global warming is the main disaster that we are creating with our hands but, we are not able to\n        recognize that we are affecting our earth a lot. Government has trying to create awareness among the people by introducing new projects like go green and\n        other various schemes to create awareness among the people. Finally, global warming is a cause for concern', "\n        Today my topic is given to me is about global warming. According to my point of view,global warming is define as the increasing in the temperature of the\n        surface area of the earth's atmosphere due to increasing in the green house effect caused by the green house gaseous and other pollutants. The main causes\n        of the global warming are increased in the population of the human begins, increased in the air pollution, deforestation and occupied the forest area. At\n        present global warming is increased by day by day, because increased in the industries and factories in the world. the factories and industries which are\n        emitted pollutant gases heavily. these gaseous damages the ozone lawyer, which is present above the earth or earth atmosphere. If ozone lawyer is gradually\n        decrease its thickness due to the heavily pollutant gases. If ozone lawyer has holes in the lawyer, the rays which are emitted from the sun is directly fall to the\n        earth. Therefore, the temperature in the earth atmosphere is increases, due to this the water in ponds, rivers and oceans are become dry and ice bugs in the\n        polar region are melted. So we have face problems on floods and hot weather conditions on the earth at the same time. Nowadays people are adopt to happy\n        life. They did not bother about what is going on the earth surface, even though they got a health problems due to global warming they did not care to global\n        warming. The temperature of the earth increase because of human begins. In olden days the temperature of the earth was normal conditions, but when\n        coming to this modern days technology was increased rapidly.", '\n        My topic is about is global warming a cause for concern? Why or why not? Nowadays global warming is very high. Nowadays population is very high they\n        create many type of pollution. The earth temperature is increase due to green house gases. Global warming is the increase of earth surface temperature due\n        to green house gases. According to scientific point of view the global warming is increasing. The main reason for global warming is humans increasing green\n        house gases in atmosphere. The green house gases are mainly released from industries. Global warming increases day by day due to green house gases like\n        carbon dioxide, Methane etc., Due to global warming nature effect earth quake and tsunami.The increase in heat also effect in water level in seas and oceans.\n        When heat level increases the glaciers present in the ocean will melt which will cause increase in the sea level. Global warming will also effect humans, Animals\n        and birds were die in this global warming. The deforestation of the forest global warming will also be very high. Nowadays industries are very high in these\n        industries air will be polluted and effect on global warming. Many chemicals are mixed in water due to these process water will be polluted and effect on\n        global warming. Global warming will effect heat very high and water will be evaporated. Due to global warming will damage ozone layer sun rays are directly\n        fall on earth and earth will be effected. Finally, I want to say to reduce global warming by plantation.', '\n        Today my topic is " Is global warming a cause for concern." The main reason of global warming is to pollute several things on earth. They air pollution, land\n        pollution, water pollution, etc. Government are taking more cares of global warming such are swatch the all areas which are surrounding to us. This less\n        quantity petrol gives more pollution to the society. The global is very important to ours and our\'s next generations. The thing which are everyone follows to\n        save the nature. Nowadays global warming is increasing . One more thing is the most of the people are using plastic very much. This is the one of the reason\n        to increase global warming. So, everyone to reduce the usage of plastic and also banned all carry bags which are used your daily life. Some industries are\n        polluted air and they are spoil the global warming. Factories are produce more wastage and all waste are through into sea. This causes all fishes are eating\n        that food and human beings are eaten that fishes and human beings are suffering some diseases. Some persons are cutting forest to their personal usage or\n        earn income they do not know to spoil the environment.The wastes from the houses and factories are putting to dumping yard and storage they produce\n        some artificial chemicals which are useful to agriculture. To reduce the global warming first to reduce the factories waste, smoking is decreased and tress\n        planting is developed. The main reason to reduce global warming is to put our surrounding clean and green', "\n        Global warming, it is the biggest problem of the world at present. Yes, definitely global warming is a cause for concern. Because it has a severe effect on the\n        world. Global warming means increasing the temperature of the earth. The temperature of the earth may increase in several ways. Some of the reasons for\n        increasing the temperature of the earth are pollution by vehicles, pollution by industries, etc. This pollution results in air pollution which, increases the\n        temperature of the earth. Many harmful gases are releasing from many industries. These gases releases from industries is not only the main reason. This\n        harmful gases are also released from air conditioners, refrigerators, etc.So to reduce global warming everyone should be aware of it. Everyone should reduce\n        the usage of air conditioners, refrigerators, vehicles, etc. The Government must take the necessary programs to reduce global warming. Global warming can\n        also be reducing by some more methods. The methods to control global warming are the plantation, reducing the usage of the air conditioners, reducing the\n        use of the vehicle, etc. It is everyone's responsibility to control pollution. We should save our world. We should reduces the pollution. Save the world it saves\n        you.", "\n        Today my topic is global warming a cause for concern. In my point of view nowadays, climate is changed because air and water filled with pollution. The\n        global warming effected by the human. Many people's are used to the won vehicles. GLobal warming also cause due to burning of fossi fuel in power plants.\n        Even some animals release methane it is also a cause for global warming. One of the major cause for global warming is deforestation. Nowadays, man cut\n        down forests for commercial purpose as a result area of forest decreases day by day. Global warming effects our earth like increasing overall level of water of\n        seas. It effects wide spread extinction of species. Many species get extinction due to global warming. However global warming the climate conditions also\n        changes. Nowadays, there is no rain falls in rainy seasons and even summer season it is very hot then when compred to the last few years. There is increases in\n        natural disasters like earthquake, tsunami, storms. There are some preventive measures to be take by every single personto reduce global warming.\n        Deforestation must be stopped and trees, reduce the motor vehicles, and the industries must construct according to pollution control board. Government also\n        invite the acts. Reduce the deforestation. Global warming is the term used to describe a gradual increass in the average temperature of the earth's\n        atmosphere and its oceans. Earth's climate is mostly influenced by the first six miles or so of the atmosphere. This is really a very thin layer if you think about\n        it. The most significant greenhouse gas is actually water vapor, not something produced directly by humankind in significant amounts. However, even slight\n        increases in atmosphericlevels of carbon dioxide can cause a substantial increase in temperature. Human beings have increased the concentration in the\n        atmosphere by about thirty percent.", '\n        Today my topic is global warming a cause for concern. According to my point of view global warming is very big problem in our society. It causes so many\n        health problems. The people get injure in their earlier stages. It is coming only because of air pollution, water pollution etc,. The air pollution is coming only\n        the use of less quality petrol, diesel. This less quantity petrol gives more pollution to the society it leads so many problems. Only not the humans, the animals\n        and trees are also facing so many problems. One more thing is the most of the people are using the plastic in this way the pollution is highly increased. First\n        of all banned this type of plastic we can reduce the half of the global warming. Some people are wasting the pure water and they are using polluted water in\n        this way the pollution is increased. So many people are take their animals into the rivers and wash it in that water so that water is polluted. When rain comes\n        the maximum water is stay at in front and behind the home. This water stay long time at the place because of this children get diseases. We can reduce the\n        global warming by using less plastic. The wastage from the plants and factories are throw to the seas. To decrease the smoking, drinking by the people in this\n        way also we can reduce the global warming. The waste water from the houses are throw to the compost and the wastage also. So finally we protect the trees\n        it will protect us.', "\n        Title:‐ Is global warming a cause of concern? Why or why not?\n        Nowadays, we the humans are involved in increasing the growth of technology and literally we are bothered about our comforts. As we are increasing in\n        technology, we have reached to a very good comfort zone. There is an good growth in technology but, we are spoiling the earth's atmosphere by emitting the\n        harmful gases. These harmful gases are making holes in the earth's ozone layer. As a result, the harmful ultra violent rays of sun are directly hitting the earth.\n        This cause green house effect. The green house effect means the earth gets heated as a result, we human beings gets a lot of skin diseases. The earth is\n        getting polluted because of following pollution such as air pollution, water pollution. The harmful gases with are released from bikes, cars and from factories.\n        we the human beings are involved in cutting the trees and make the world totally concrete. So, the oxygen gets decreased literally. So we should avoid cutting\n        the trees and instead of cutting we use plant trees where ever possible. So that, our earth gets green again. The global warming is cause for concern because,\n        as we are engaged in cutting the trees and polluting it as ever we can by not bothering about what will happen to earth in future. Scientists are saying that\n        the ice mountains in polar region are started melting due to the green house effect. As the sun is heating the earth the mountains in the polar region are\n        melting so that the water density is increasing. The land percent is decreasing and the water levels are increasing. There are some reports that small Islands\n        were already get drawn into the oceans. So the humans should wake and start some awareness activities. Some prevention tips also have to develop.", '\n        One of the major troubles that the world is facing is global warming. Global warming is due to the effects of greenhouse gases in the environment. Some of\n        these gases are carbon‐dioxide,methane and gases that are emitted from factories, refrigerators. These gases corrodes the ozone layer which is present in the\n        troposphere. Ozone layer consist of three oxygen molecules. The greenhouse gases are weightless, so they directly go to the ozone layer and reacts with it.\n        Thus holes are being formed in the ozone layer. As a result the, the Ultra Violet radiation emitted from the sun rays are directly entering into the planets\n        atmosphere. Ultra Violet radiation is very hazardous. When these rays are directly exposed to humans, several skin cancers will be occurred. Due to global\n        warming the ice present in the polar regions is melting. This increases the percentage of water present in the oceans. When the percentage of water is being\n        increased, the water will raise above the sea level, causing heavy tsunamis. Humans are main responsible for this global warming. Deforestation also causes\n        global warming. The amount of carbon‐dioxide is being increased due to this deforestation. In earth, plants and trees are the only things that absorbs carbon‐\n        dioxide. Destroying is easy than creating. Destruction can done in seconds but creation takes years of time. In the above question asked, I do not consider\n        global warming a cause for concern because there are some safety measure that can be taken to avoid or reduce global warming. It need not be considered\n        as a concern because recent observations show that the ozone layer is patchi', '\n        Today my topic is global warming a cause for concern. Global warming occurs mainly two main causes. Firstly, emission of fossil fuels in power plant.\n        Secondly, burning of gasoline in industries. The major cause of global warming is deforestation by cutting trees. In my view, carbon dioxide is vastly occurred\n        in universe because there are many cars, buses, vehicles, etc. In my point of view, we should decrease the cause of global warming by following reasons.\n        Firstly, we will place gardens in our house. Secondly, we should use cars like less emission of fuels. One of the cause of global warming is depletion of ozone\n        layer. One of the major solution in cause of global warming is to develop afforestation by implementing most of the carbon dioxide is absorbed by plants. In\n        our country so many industries are implementing with new technology however they produce fossil fuels, gasoline, etc. Demand in our country on cars is most\n        expensive than others. Government should develop our country in a green way. Government will implement some rules regarding deforestation and give\n        warning to the industries. Finally, i conclude that we will implement trees in every house and providing garden for every street. we should decrease the\n        pollution coming from vehicles like cars, buses, lorry, etc. Government should take care of above solution and implement some rules and regulations.', '\n        Today my topic is "Is global warming a cause for concern." Yes, in my opinion global warming is one of the critical issues facing by our society. Global\n        warming means the raising up of the temperatures on the earth and unacceptable weather conditions. We know that the climatic conditions are changing\n        rapidly day to day and also there is no order in the climatic conditions, there are not following the seasonal measures every year. These changes is because of\n        the global warming. The global warming is happening because of the greenhouse gases that are evolving from the different sources like industries, vehicles,\n        refrigerators, etc., all these human created machines are releasing the most harmful gases in to the atmosphere like carbon dioxide, chlorofluorocarbons, etc.\n        These gases are high density gases and these are entering into the stratosphere due to their high density these gases forms into precipitates and forms as a\n        clouds, these clouds contains acids of those gases due to reaction with the gases present in the atmosphere it leaves acid as the rains, these rains are coming\n        to the earth the dangerous effects to the human race.\n        Effects of the global warming on the human race are the persons effected to the acid rains they may effected by the cancer in the futyurf', "\n        Global warming is the main problem in the world. Global warming is mainly caused by carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide. Global warming raises the\n        earth's temperature level. Nowadays, global warming is mainly caused by industries. Plastic also causes the global warming. Industries will release carbon\n        dioxide and carbon monoxide which causes the global warming. People are using pesticides, insecticides, and fertilizers for high crop yielding. Smoke coming\n        out from industries causes global warming. the gasses released from vehicles, washing machines causes the global warming.\n        Global warning is caused by pollution also. Global warming can demage the health of the people. It also demages the area of forestation. Global warming is\n        the main problem in the present world. Global warming is the increases the Earth's average surface temperature due to effect of greenhouse gases, such as\n        carbon dioxide emission from fossil fuels or from deforestation, which traps heat that would otherwise escape from Earth. The basic cause seems to be a rise\n        in atmospheric carbon dioxide, as predicted in hundred years ago. Changes resulting from global warming may include rising sea levels due to the melting of\n        the polar ice caps, as well as an increase in occurrence and severity of storms and other serve weather events. The increased volumes of human activities\n        causes the global warming.", '\n        Yes, global warming is one of cause for concern. It affects the climate, atmosphere and make it disposed. Due to this the oxygen levels in the air are decreased\n        and the carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide are increased. This is caused due to lack of trees and more number of industries. People cutting trees for their\n        own benefits and cannot planting new trees. Deforestation is the one of the cause for global warming.\n        Some of the Green house gases like carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide affecting the atmosphere very widely. We have to contro these gases by planting trees\n        and avoiding deforestration. Usage of plastics is also one of the cause for global warming. Plastics did not compose in the soil. It takes hundreds of years to\n        compose. Usage of polythene covers is also one of the cause for global warming. Polythene also did not compose in the soil and it also takes many years to\n        compose.\n        The preventive steps all the human beings have to take to decrease the global warming are reducing deforestation, decreasing the usage of biodegradable\n        polymers like plastic, polythene, decreasing the more number of industries and decreasing the usage of vehicles which are running by using petrol and diesel.\n        Instead of using petrol, diesel vehicles use the vehicles which are running by manual and by solar power. If the global warming will continues like this only,\n        there will be no more living beings in the nature to live due to the leakage of oxygen.So, we have to educate all the people to plant new plants and do not cut\n        the old trees.', "\n        Global warming is a major issue in the world. One of the greatest environmental problems is global warming. It is caused by many people and atmospheric\n        conditions. Presence of excessive amount of carbon dioxide and greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere, it is called global warming. Some of the acts are there\n        related to the deforestation. Nowadays, deforestation is one of the problems. If we cut so many trees. it will effect on our life as well. So, every one reduces\n        the global warming because we must protect the nature and animal's life.\n        Global warming can also effect on the ozone layer. If ozone layer is effected, some harmful rays fell on to the earth. So, every human has some skin problems\n        and diseases. Most of the people do not have any information about the global warming. Global warming caused by automobile industries and power\n        industries. So, we should reduce those industries.\n        If we plant the trees, Global warming will be reduced. So every one should not do cut the trees. If We take fuels from earth, it will also effect on human. So,\n        every industry should use the renewable energy, it will decrease global warming,\n        Some people say like earth is our god. So, we should protect our earth by reducing of global warming. Global warming effects on increasing of sea levels. If\n        sea level is increased, it will damage the world's atmosphere. Most of the people died. It will kill the every one's life.\n        My conclusion is global warming is killing people and animals. It will damage beauty of the atmosphere. so, we must protect our atmosphere, Firstly we\n        should stop cutting of trees and releasing of greenhouse gasses into the environment. Increasing of sea level causes spreading of diseases. Nowadays, global\n        warming is more and some people don not know about our life as well.", "\n        Today's topic is about global warming a cause of concern. Yes, in our world earth is affected by global warming. There are so many causes for global warming.\n        Global warming means heating of earth. The causes of earth heating are human activities. Human activities leads to the global warming. The industrial waste\n        coming from the factories are main cause of global warming. The chemicals releasing from the industries are mixing with soil and causes global warming. This\n        global warming again affects the human health. Global warming not only affect the soil, but also human health. Human activities are the main cause of global\n        warming. Global warming leads to the heating of earth and it divides the earth into different parts. To control global warming first we have to control the\n        chemicals which are releasing from factories. Chemicals and acids which are releasing from factories are most affecting the earth.To our earth we have follow\n        some control measures. Controlling the flow chemicals and acids, we can control global warming. Global warming means soil erosion. That is soil is affected\n        by our natural activities. Cause of global warming water which is we used to drinking purpose is also affecting. To control global warming we used to follow\n        some controlling techniques. We have to crate the awareness among the people. We have create the awareness about causes of global warming. And, by\n        using some controlling techniques we can save our world from global warming. We have to ban the factories which are realising chemicals. So, global\n        warming a cause for concern.", '\n        Global warming is one of the major factor which is effecting the life of various species living on the earth. The global warming is mainly caused due to the\n        green house gases. The sun rays falling on the earth creates heat on the earth surface. These sun rays are effected by the green house gases and creating\n        more heat on earth surface rather than the required amount of heat. The increase of the heat on earth surface is very dangerous. The increase in the heat will\n        effects human life, animal life and aquatic life. The increase in heat also effects on water level in seas and oceans. When the heat level increases, the glaciers\n        present in the oceans will melt which will cause increase in the sea level. Global warming causes damage to the nature. The animals and plants present in the\n        nature are unable to adjust to the increase in the heat levels on the earth. The increase in heat level results in evaporation of water which results in the death\n        of aquatic life. The main reasons for global warming are cutting of trees, use of chemicals and the gases released from the industries. To reduce the global\n        warming effect, plants should be grown and emission of gases from industries should be controlled. The government should take some preventive measures\n        to control the global warming. The effects due to the global warming should be explained to the people particularly to the uneducated people. This creates\n        some awareness among the people and make them to think about global warming. It is not possible to control the global warming in a small period of time,\n        but it can be controlled up to some extent. To reduce the global warming one should follow all preventive measures like controlling the use of vehicles and\n        controlling the use of chemicals. Our present actions will effect the future. so, the controlling of global warming depends on our present actions.', '\n        Today my topic is global warming a cause for concern? Nowadays all the countries are worrying about global warming. Global warming affects the life of\n        human. The sun rays are directly reaching to earth, due to global warming. The reasons for increasing global warming is industrialization and technology\n        improvement. The pollution also main cause for global warming. The daily usage of people like motor cycles, cars and heavy machines are releasing carbon\n        dioxide. The refrigerators and air conditioners also releasing chemicals. The people in urban areas are not aware of global warming. The global warming\n        causes some skin problems like cancer, skin burning. The earth is already damaged some part due to global warming. The warming of earth affects on ozone\n        layer surrounded the earth. The sun rays will directly reach to earth if the ozone layer is affected. The industrialization also affects the earth by releasing\n        various chemicals releasing into atmosphere. The forest ration in the earth decreasing day by day. People should aware of global warming to save earth from\n        global warming. If the ratio of forests increase in earth help to reduce the cause of global warming. People are always thinking about their own life. They are\n        not thinking about feature generations. If the global warming is increases then the feature generations will face many problems. Global warming means rapid\n        increase in temperature of the earth. If the forest ratio increase then there may be a chance of reduce rapid global warming. The people should find\n        alternative ways for using cars and motor cycles to save feature generations. The global warming is reducing the life span of human.', '\n        Today our topic is about "Is global warming a cause for concern?" The global warming is defined as the temperature rise in the earth surface temperature and\n        the greenhouse effect is called global warming. The greenhouse effect occurs due to emission of toxic acid and industrial emissions. The decreasing rate of\n        oxygen results in global warming. The global warming results in climatic changes, health damage, soil erosion. The deforestation and emission of\n        chlorofluorocarbon results in the damage of ozone layer. The damage of ozone layer results in exposing to radiation effect. The trees in the forest should be\n        cultivated. Basically, cultivate an optimistic mind, use your imagination, consider alternatives, dare to believe that you can make possible what others think is\n        impossible. The imagination is important in our life. The trees should be planted near our houses. We should protect our environment. smoking is injurious to\n        health. The tobacco trees are spoiling our health. The consumption of alcohol and smoking should be reduced. The global warming results in spoiling the\n        health conditions of the people. The global warming can reduce by taking some steps. They are, reduce the use of plastic covers, do not cut the trees. The\n        work should be noted in the electronic format. So, we can save the paper. The cutting of trees will reduce. The schools have to conduct the activities like in\n        protecting the environment. Everyone should feel responsibility in protecting the environment. We should give the same type of environment to the future\n        generation. This results in their good health. The natural resources rate is decreasing. We should concentrate on that thing. We should save the water. The\n        refrigerators and air conditioners release chlorofluorocarbons.\n        Finally, I like to conclude that we should protect our environment and we should survive in a good manner with a good health.', '\n        Pollution effects the environment. If in environment pollution increases then, it affects the ozone layer. If ozone layer damages then, it automatically affects\n        the environment. Global warming means it affecting the environment. Nowadays many people using vehicles. By using this the gas will release into\n        environment and it affects the global warming. In vehicles some of them are using petrol and diesel combinly. Due to this So much of gas is released into the\n        air it affects the people. Nowadays people are smoking, this also affects the near people and who are taking that air causes health diseases. If our environment\n        looks dirty then, in some cases our health going into wrong way. If environment polluted then, all are getting health problems. By all knowing this we can take\n        care about our self and as well as environment. We should clean our environment. Do not throw waste materials into roads, it causes health problems to you\n        and your neighbours. In the environment so many gases are release into air, this may affect the all people who are taking that air. Nowadays so many people\n        are drink and driving the vehicles this also affects the environment. We should keep our environment clean, it gives good health. In public places smoking is\n        banned, but many people not following that rule. If we follow the rules then, we protect our health. Global warming is all based on the environment.Due to\n        pollution ozone layer decreases day by day. Before few years ozone layer was affected by the environment and gets small hole in that, due to this we are\n        getting heat. Yes, global warming a cause of concern. Even though it is not a summer season it seems like summer season.', "\n        Global warming means raise of earth temperature due to green house gases is called global warming. The main reasons for global warming is earth's surface\n        temperature increases, water pollution, land pollution, air pollution. Mainly human population increase, needs also increases. Based upon there needs, so\n        many factories are establishing. Waste materials comes from all factories are major reason for global warming. It has adverse effect on air pollution. Due to\n        this, ozone layer is getting depletion, so infrared rays coming to earth. These rays increases earth temperature and also effects human's health conditions.\n        Waste material are releasing into rivers and seas, without out purifying. Due to these so many fishes are eating waste materials which are released from\n        factories. Human's eating these fishes are also effected. Due to global warming, sea water level also increases, which results in floods. Due to global warming,\n        earth's temperature increases and it leads to ice melting at poles, which results is sea water level increases.\n        Causes for global warming are a deforestation, sea water level increases, climatic changes. Methods to reduce global warming are decrease the use of plastic\n        material, because it does not mix with earth surface. It takes so many years to mix with earth. Increasing the trees growth, reduces the green houses gases.\n        Government also takes prevent steps to reduce global warming. The main reason for air pollution is cars and motors. So we have reduce the unnecessary use\n        of motor and cars for short distances.", '\n        Today our topic is about global warming a cause for concern, in this contemporary world everything become corporated and commercialised due to this the\n        environment get effected very badly day by day. Global warming is mainly because of warming of earth due to more dangerous gases in the air. These gases\n        released from the industries, factories, companies and houses. Gases are released at great extent which cause the global warming on the earth. Our\n        environment is get effected day by day due to this global warming which makes the earth heater than any other. This global warming is not only because of\n        gases but also wastage from the houses. Nowadays from the homes there is a lot of wastage which effected the earth surface voraciously. Therefore, care\n        should be taken by the every citizen who lives on the earth at least for the future generations why because they also have the right to live in this earth. Hence,\n        government should provide facilities for the industries and factories for placement of their building far away for the people. This makes the decrement of\n        global warming on the earth which is good for the people who live on the earth. Not only the government people also has the responsibility to take after the\n        earth not let it effected by the dangerous gases like co2, chlorofloro carbons. Now this is our turn to take the everything in our control for better environment\n        to our country as well as our society. Currently, we has the great impact by the global warming which is dangerous to earth as well as the people who lives the\n        earth. There is so many animals, birds are get effected by the earth global warming. Which should not be done for the sake of our society or for the sake our\n        future generations.', '\n        Global warming is a problem for every species. In olden days the rays coming from the sun is reflected back. But, Nowadays due to pollution the sun rays\n        coming to the earth but, not reflect. Due this the earth getting heat this is called global warming. Due to this global warming every species are effected. The\n        global warming effects are the some rare species are vanish. Global warming is increases day by day. Human inventions are the main cause increasing global\n        warming.\n        Producing the current in the thermal power plants. This thermal plants are released carbon dioxide. This carbon dioxide is main component of pollution. And\n        making the global warming. Due to global warming the many health problems are increased. Like skin cancer, mental illness and many cancers are effected by\n        global warming. Suppose any one having some type of cancer. That cancer is effect increase by this global warming.\n        Due this global warming the sea level day by day increases. The ice in the world is melt due this heat. So, that the sea level increases and many islands are\n        disappeared.\n        Some of the species in the sea also effected by the global warming. And there are many changes are placed in the sea. The birds also effected by this\n        warming. We need decrease the pollution and green house gases production things. It will help the our future generation.', '\n        The global warming is major problem in these world. Global warming occurs mainly by the use of dangerous gases which are releasing into the environment.\n        By releasing this gases into the atmosphere the environment is damaging. The people is facing many problems by breathing these gases. The deforestation\n        and industrial emissions are the main cause for this global warming. By increasing the man power on forests the trees are decreasing. The trees are main\n        source for healthy environment. By cutting trees in the forest the land side is increased and the animals and number of spices are decreased. The government\n        should take strict act at man power on forests. And the other global warming is greenhouse gases which are released by the industries and vehicles. The gases\n        which are releasing by these may effect the environment so high.The main gases are carbon monoxide which is released by the vehicles and carbon oxide by\n        the industries. Recently, the National Green Tribunal has banned the vehicles which eccede more than 2000 cc. By doing these the pollution can be controlled\n        in the society. The government should pass the rules on these global issues in the country which are increasing day by day. If the environment situation does\n        not controls it will become so critical and major problem. It affects not only one country it affects all over world. To overcome these problem the people\n        should follow the particular rules. If we keep environment clean it will give results for the future. To make better environment the industries and vehicles\n        should be decreased to make environment healthy.However, The environment looks very plesent', "\n        Global warming is one of the most serious problems that the world is facing today. Global waming means the increase of the earth's surface temperature due\n        to the green house gases. Green house gases like carbondioxide and carbonmonoxide are released from the factories into the atmosphere. This will lead to\n        the depletion of ozone layer which proctects us from the harmful ultraviolet radiation emitted from the sun. When the fossil fuels are burnt, they release green\n        house gases. Certain amount of heat is absorbed by the earth surface and the remaining amount is reflected into the atmosphere. This is main reason for the\n        increase of surface temperature of earth.\n        Global warming has many adverse effects on the nature. It results in melting of polar ice caps and may lead to flooding in the low lying areas. The animals\n        living in the polar region are losing their habitats. It leads to the extinction of many species of animals which causes ecological imbalance. Global warming\n        leads to depletion of ozone layer which protects from the harmful radiation. The people living in ozone depleted are exposed to harmful radiation which leads\n        them to harmful diseases like skin cancer and sun burns. Global warming also causes desertification. It also effects the agriculture and growth of plants which\n        causes disturbance to the environment. The animals are becoming extinct because of the high rise in the temperature.\n        We should reduce the usage of vehicles for the shorter distances and preferbly use eco‐friendly vehicles. The Government should take stepsto reduce the\n        usage of fossil fuels and start promoting the use of alternative sources. Plants should be planted to reduce the levels of carbondioxide in the atmosphere.\n        Awareness programs should be conducted to create awareness among people about the problems of global warming. So, each and every individaul should\n        take it as a responsibility to protect the mother earth.", '\n        Today my topic is about global warming a cause of concern. Now‐a‐days, In India global warming is a harmful cause affected by radiations like UV radiations\n        ultra violet rays, carbohydrates etc. These radiations causes cancer, diabetes to human beings. These radiations damage the earth ozone layer and the UV\n        radiations directly falling on the earth. These UV radiations causes disease to human beings. First of all global warming is causing by Industries,factories etc.\n        People using covers and throwing covers outside and these covers not involved in earth and spoils the soil. The people using motor bikes and these\n        motorbikes spreading dark smoke causing global warming. Industries like chemical factories are releasing different kind of chemicals to the water and spoiling\n        the water. These water drunk by us causing diseases like cholera. Industries also spreading the smoke to the atmosphere and damaging the ozone layer. To\n        reduce the global warming people need to follow several precautions. The precautions are does not use covers and keep the surroundings clean. The people\n        use the less smoke motor bikes to reduce the pollution. Industries does not flows the chemicals into the water. Give permission to the industries where does\n        less harm to the earth. The implementation of all these reduce the global warming. the people put the surroundings clean and neat and does not use which\n        are harmful to earth atmosphere. ozone layer is affected by pollution is d', "\n        Today's topic is about global warming a cause for concern. Yes, global warming is cause for concern because so many people suffer due to global warming,\n        global warming mainly affects the oceans and seas by burning the ice cubes and increases the water level in oceans and seas for example, we all are know\n        that tsunamis are mainly because of global warming and cyclones are also because of global warming.\n        We have some methods to protect the earth from global warming those methods are, first we increase greenery in our surrounding and reduce the use of\n        refrigerator and air conditioners, etc. Another method to reduce global warming is less use of vehicles, vehicles emits a lot of toxic gases in to the atmosphere\n        those gases are transformed through out the world with the use of clouds and it melts the ice cubes in polar region, melting of ice cubes increases the water\n        level in sea and ocean, one more method to reduce the global warming is control the wastage of industries because industries contaminate the water as well\n        as pollute the environment and the gases from industries are also reason for global warming to avoid this problems industries are placed away from the cities\n        and control the gases which are emitted from the industries by using gas filter it can convert toxic gases in to non‐toxic gases.\n        Everyone in the world responsible for global warming no one is exclude from it, so everyone take care of earth by conducting some awareness programs to\n        the people who did not know about global warming and everyone should take care of tress because tress reduces the temperature on atmosphere, tress play\n        vital role in global warming so growing tress is one of the best way for reducing global warming and increasing parks in our city we can lead a healthy life.", "\n        Today's topic is about global warming is a cause for concern or not. Global warming is the effect of increase in Earth's average temperature, it is caused by the\n        green house gases. The green house gases are produced due to burning of fossil fuels in the industries and burning in vehicles for the movement. The green\n        house gases are like water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, and ozone. The carbon dioxide is mostly effect the global warming in all of the world, it has the\n        most important green house gas to effect the global warming. The carbon dioxide effect is decease by the increasing plantation. The most effect of the global\n        warming is deforestation. So, cultivation of trees is decrease the effect the global warming. The trees are observing the carbon dioxide and the release the\n        oxygen for the human beings. The human beings are depends on the trees, but at present days the deforestation is caused the global warming and also\n        people have effect for this problem. The rapid increasing industries in the world, these industries are produce more carbon dioxide and it can be decreased by\n        cultivation of trees. The cultivation of trees are mostly useful for decreasing the Earth's average atmosphere. The government will more take care about this\n        global warming by increasing cultivation of trees. Engineers are concentrate on this global warming and develop the new projects.", "\n        Today's topic is about global warming a cause for concern. In my point of view global warming is very bad. In our country pollution is very high. Many people\n        using vehicles it causes air pollution. Many people water using different ways. Water pollution is very high in our country. In my point of view people are\n        wasting water. Students are wasting water. In factory waste materials are leaving into good water and pollute the water. People and students are thinking\n        there mindset life is beautiful. Nowadays many people are cut the tree it causes global warming. Present scenario many people are using vehicles lots of\n        pollution. To overcome the global warming problem one way is there which is planting. By the planting we can reduce the pollution in our atmosphere.\n        People should know the about global warming problem and how to avoid that problem also. Some educated people should make aware about global\n        warning that how do not know about this global warning problem. If, do all these things we can avoid the pollution in air and likewise we will overcome the\n        global warming problem also. So, reduce pollution live healthy lives.", '\n        Global warming is the main problem in the world, it is also called as green house effect. The increase in the heat of earth heavily is result in global warming.\n        The population increases day by day, but land is limited we cannot increase the area of land. Hence, we should we use this land properly, but due global\n        warming the ice caps are melting and the level of sea increases as a result the coastal are sinked in the sea and many people have lost their habitat. Nowadays\n        the usage of vehicles increases, this increases consumption of fossil fuels. The burning of this fuels releases high concentration of carbon dioxide. This gas\n        goes to top of atmosphere and get reflected by ozone layer reaches the earth again. Hence, the heat of earth increases heavily as a result the life of trees on\n        the it will decrease. The world has been occupied by oceans is more and hence we should use limited land very carefully otherwise, people have no place to\n        survive.\n        The problem of global warming is not only restricted to one country, all countries face this problem. Hence every country should be responsible for to prevent\n        the earth to become heated. Trees play a very important role in the prevention of heat of earth and hence everyone should protect the trees and give birth to\n        new trees. Today the technology is improved day by day, but this technology should not effect the nature cycle. The increase in the population results in\n        deforestation as a result the percentage of rains fall decrease. This will also reason for global warming. Hence, the government should announce new schemes\n        for people to encourage towards growing trees and less usage of fuels. People should use public transports so as to less combustion in fuels.', "\n        Today's topic, is global warming is a cause for concern? why or why not? Yes in my opinion, global warming is a concern because it changes the environment.\n        Global warming means increasing of heat in the environment, global warming effects the earth by damaging the ozone layer, changes in the climate,\n        increasing of heat due to pollution emitted by the human use. Several green house gases and poisonous gasses like chloro carbons which is emitted by\n        factories, these gasses cause damage to the ozone layer due to chemical reaction in the environment. Global warming states that increasing of heat on the\n        earth, this cause melting of ice at the north and south pole. This rises the water level and decreases the land on the earth. The rise of water also cause the\n        tsunami, global warming also affects the origin of climate this cause ecological imbalance. If there is no rains then there is no plants, no crops, this cause\n        decrease of forest and then it leads to soil erosion. Soil erosion means the land lost it's capability of storing water and lost its fertility. so in order avoid all\n        these concern we should take care of global warming. To reduce the global warming, we should plant the trees this helps to cool the earth surface gradually,\n        use of vehicles should be very low, factories should be pollution free. Increase the use of recycling products and reduce the use of plastic and other non‐\n        recycling materials w", '\n        My topic is about Is global warming a cause for concern? Nowadays global warming increases day by day. The sun rays directly fall on the earth it causes\n        global warming due to green house gases. The earth average temperature is increases due to green house gases. According to scientific point of view global\n        warming increases day by day. Mainly industries also one reason for global warming. Green house gases are released from industries just like carbon dioxide,\n        methane and other gases. Global warming is controlled by reducing deforestation and should be take some measures to industries. Global warming also\n        effect the humans, animals, birds and so on. The global warming causes many health problems.Due to green house gases the ozone layer effected mainly. The\n        effect of ozone layer causes many health and skin problems. The water is evaporated because the earth temperature increases. Nowadays every one effect the\n        environment. Mainly the global warming is controlled by reducing deforestation. The climatic also changes due to global warming. the whether conditions are\n        changes time to time because the is high due to global warming. The main causes of global warming are cutting of trees, deforestation, release gases from\n        industries and using of bikes. The global warming is reduced by plantation and reducing deforestation, some control measures follow the industries.\n        According my point of view global warming is controlled by reducing green house gases. Finally i conclude that global warming is maintained by reducing\n        deforestation, planting the trees.', "\n        Global Warming means increasing the earth's temperature and pruduces the heat substances in the environment. We studied about the global warming in\n        our school days, but we are now seeing practical in the environment. It is the main cause for the concern, because it has many disadvantages and it effects the\n        environment and the people living in the environment. The green house gases effects the environment too. The main cause for the global warming is,\n        releasing the harmful gases in the environment which are comming from the industries. These gases which are emitting from the industries cause global\n        warming. Some of the gases which are emitting from the industries effect the health of the people and leads to the harmful diseases. It effects the air in the\n        environment the impure gases releasing from the industries are mixed with the pure gases and cause air pollution. The air pollution cause many diseases it\n        not effects the human but, it also effects the environment.\n        The impure gases that are releasing from the industries produces the heat and the earth gets heat which causes the global warming. In order to reduce the\n        global warming we have to take some preventive measures and we have to follow them. We can reduce the heat by taking the following steps.\n        Firstly, the industries should be constructed at the ourskirts of the town. The trees should be grown all around the industry because, the trees absorbes the\n        heat emitting from the industries. Every month they have to chech the condition of the gases that are releasing in to the environment. The government should\n        have to take the necessary steps to prevent the pollution emitting from the industrie.", '\n        Global warming is the big environmental issue we are facing as a great challenge. SO, everyone should know about global warming, Its causes, and solving\n        techniques. Nowadays, we can see that abnormal climatic conditions, because of the occurance of global warming. Human beings are the main cause, for the\n        effect of global warming. Every human being should feel responsible about the prevention techniques of global warming. Students should know about the\n        causes, and they have to step forward to control global warming. Green house gases like carbon, methane are the main cause of global warming. It impacts\n        the earth directly by rising of sea water levels, melting of ice, raising of volcanoes, etc. These are the main causes due to effect of global warming. It has been\n        measured that last six years are the warmest year when compared to before years. The abnormal global warming calls to unexpected disasters on earth, which\n        causes great damage to huam beings. We can clearly notice that, climate is changing day by day with out any consideration of seasons. Earlier, we divided our\n        seasons into three types like rainy, summer, and winter. Therefore, these seasons will follows respectively, but by the effect of global warming the seasons are\n        irrevelent to human beings. Ozone layer plays a major role to protect us from direct sun rays. Nowadays, by the cause of global warming it was damaging\n        gradually, Therefore, the sun rays will directly fall on earth this leads to skin cancer. So, we can clearly say thet all this causes are because of human beings.\n        Increasing global warming causes evoparation of water into the atmosphere, which turns as green house gas ang again cause of rise in global warming. The\n        ultimate cause of such reasons are abnormal growth in population, deforestation, advancement of technology. So, keeping all these factors in mind, human\n        beings should take preventive methods which are eco‐friendly.', "\n        Today's topic is about, is global warming a cause for concern? Surely, it is a major threat to world. The whole world is thinking about the global warming,\n        because the effects of global warming are unavoidable. Global warming means the temperature of earth rises to vary high value up to one fifty degrees. I\n        would like to accord with given statement firmly.\n        There are multifarious points to shore up my point of view. First and foremost one is mainly due to deforestation the temperature of earth changing its value\n        day by day. Pollution caused by vehicles and factories are also cause for it. The recent report of world health organization is shocking to whole world, because\n        within a few years temperature of globe go to one twenty degrees and major countries are releasing sixty thousand ton of carbon emissions per year.\n        Existence of life become miserable if this, further continues for remaining years. Flora and fauna are loosing their presence in the world. Further emphasizing\n        on my point of view, that One thousand species of different kinds extincted from last few years. Glaciers are loosing their presence in the world and twenty\n        two glaciers are already vanished from globe. The lifetime of fresh water lakes are decreasing due to global warming. sustainable conditions for life is\n        decreasing due to global warming. Countries are fighting for water resources, twenty percent people from all over world are effecting with skin diseases,\n        because of global warming.\n        Nations all over the world should take care over about this life threatening problem and they have to take preventive measures to get rid of the problem.\n        Afforestation all over the world may decrease temperature rise and we have decrease the pollution coming out from the vehicles and factories. We have to\n        make earth more green and get rid of that problem.", '\n        The topic is about global warming a cause for concern. In my point of view global warming is rapidly increasing everyday. People are using different types of\n        home appliances which release carbon dioxide. These gasses affects the nature which give us oxygen. Due to this global warming increasing and people are\n        facing different problems and lead to different kinds of diseases. we have to take certain steps to prevent global warming. people who are using cars, bikes,\n        must reduce their release of gasses and travel in public transport. Government should take certain steps to prevent global warming and people should take\n        part in that to avoid the global warming. In feature there is no healthy life if it goes on. Steps can be taken to prevent the global warming by these the feature\n        generation will at a safe side. People who plant more trees and make green everywhere may reduce the global warming. In same manner taking some steps\n        will help people to face global warming. One need to think about society for the feature. The main cause of global warming is pollution people are using more\n        number of cars,bikes from these vehicles gasses are releasing and these gasses cause global warming. Planting tress helps people to keep in a safe side from\n        global warming. It is our duty to make nature beautiful. Global warming can be reduced by taking care. Reduce the use of cars, bikes and avoid pollution.', '\n        In my perspective, global warming is a cause for concern. According to present circumstances, it is the burning issue in the universe. The main cause of global\n        warming is pollution. The pollution are of different types such as air pollution,water pollution,soil pollution and noise pollution. And the release of green\n        house gases are main reason for global warming. And increase in global warming is not only through releasing the green houses gases but also through the\n        release of wastes from industry. Through release of gases, air pollution takes place and through release of huge sounds, noise pollution takes place and\n        through release of water wastes, water pollution takes place. So, first of all to reduce the global warming we should reduce the pollution. And due to the\n        industries, factories, environmental issues global warming is increasing day by day. And due to this, there will be release of harmful gases from earths\n        atmosphere which results in different kinds of diseases like skin cancer, rashes on body. And not only the release of gases is taking place due to global\n        warming. Acid rains are also taking place which causes different kinds of diseases. And due to the pollution we we suffer from different diseases. And we\n        should follow some rules and regulations to decrease the global warming. And we should plant the tress which decrease the global warming. And also we\n        should create awareness in each and everyone against this global warming.', '\n        Globalwarming is already having significant and harmful effects on our communities, our health, andourclimate. sea level rise is accelerating. The number of\n        large wildfires is growing. Dangerous heat waves are becoming more common.

Local source of carbon emissions vary from region to region, suggestions that solutions are often decided at the community\n        level. I can conclude that global warming is reduces the human health.', '\n        Global warming is a burning issue over the globe these days. Basically, what do global warming mean is, increasing of earth atmospheric temperature\n        drastically due to many factors. Coming down the lane, the first and foremost important one of the issues is, pollution through excessive usage of non‐\n        renewable energy resources which have carbon emmissions in to the atmosphere of the earth. The emmisions obtained by burning these are forming a\n        blanket over the earths atmosphere which is resulting in increasing of temperatures over the land surface, as carbondioxide and green house gases are not\n        permitting the reradiated solar energy back into the space and rather reflecting back the radiation to the atmospheric layers. This results in exponential\n        increase of temperature, which inturn makes iceglaciers come down to the sea level, which is increasing the water level of the huge water bodies. As a result\n        areas at down plane will be prone to tsunami, huge floods, and so on and so forth. Areas facing these natural calamities suffer a lot with drought conditions\n        and a lot of loss on properties as well as livelihood. Next comes into the role is unawareness of people about the climate and disturbing it further extent\n        leading serious damage of water bodies thereby, having hazardous effects on future generation people. Polluting the water bodies which are the sources of\n        forming clouds is getting polluted so this is mirrors to acid rains back to the earth atmosphere. If this continues the future generations ma ynot know what an\n        ice glacier is. Decrease of ice glaciers have adverse effects on polar aquatic life, they are facing the problems of extinction because of global warming. So,\n        considering all the above stated problems man has to change his way of thinking towards the environment and try to adapt new technologies which are eco‐\n        friendly and have less impact on atmosphere and increase forest areas rather than urbanisation.', '\n        In my point of view, global warming is the rising problem around the world. It tends to a dangerous situation. Mainly, global warming increases the\n        temperature on earth. Global warming comes due to deforestation. Every member cutting the forests and it makes as a shelter. Some people is earning\n        money by cutting forests. It tends to a dangerous situation. Moreover, pollution is also the main reason which raises global warming. So, many members are\n        using vehicles highly. The main reason for global warming is a human being. The global warming can be reduced only when deforestation can be reduced.\n        The change must be occurs only when human being. Mainly, many members do not know what is global warming. Government should take further steps\n        reduce global warming.Recently, many plastic items are coming into the market. We can say it also one of the reason. Plastic cannot mix on the earth. It tends\n        to pollution. Global warming can be reduced only when the planting trees must be important. Practically, this is impossible. Global warming also', '\n        Yes, global warming is the main cause for concern. Nowadays global warming is a big problem for all the living things on the earth. The effect of global\n        warming is getting increased by day by day. Due to this global warming all the living things on the earth are facing many problems. Mainly the global\n        warming shows the effect in the summer. The earth is getting heated day by day. Due to this many living things are dying mainly in the summer.\n        The main cause of the global warming is human. Nowadays the technology is getting increased and the rate of the pollution is also getting increased. The\n        gasses released from the factories and industries are the main problem for the environment pollution and also for global warming. Due to this environment\n        pollution and global warming many species are getting disappeared. And many valuable plants which are very use full are also disappeared. Due to the\n        dangerous gasses that are released from the factories, industries and mortars the ozone layer is getting effected. And this gasses are effecting the ozone layer\n        and allowing the cosmic rays on to the earth. Due to this cosmic rays the earth is getting heated and finally leads to the global warming. From now with in\n        hundred years the earth will become ten time more heater then now. Because of this I request all the people to be careful and stop using the things which will\n        effect the earths environment. Please start planting trees this will decrease the global warming. Nowadays the technology is getting increased day by day and\n        due to this the environment pollution and global warming is also getting increased. Due to this all the living all the living things on the earth are getting\n        effected and many species are also disappeared.', "\n        Global warming is the biggest problem in the present world. People are cutting the plants and trees. Usage of vehicles and fossil fuels increasing the earth's\n        heat. Earth is getting heated up. People are damaging the world. The usage of fuels and other plastic materials making the earth to loose its fertility. The\n        plastic and fibre materials are heating up the earth. Usage of refrigerators and air conditioners are the main cause for depletion of ozone layer. Gases like\n        carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and other dangerous gases killing the environment. People are using pesticides, insecticides and fertilizers for high crop\n        yielding. The usage of these harmful things land is becoming barren. Soil pollution is taking place because of the usage of fertilizers in high amounts.\n        Pollution plays a main role in global warming. Pollution is of various forms. Polluting land by fertilizers is known as land pollution. Polluting air by releasing\n        harmful gases into the air is known as air pollution. Green house gases are the major contributers for air pollution. Soil erosion is the major contributer of soil\n        pollution. The gases released from industries and vehicles cause air pollution. People and government has to implement awarenees programs among people\n        about global warming.", '\n        Yes, global warming is a cause for concern. Present days global warming became a boon for earth and environment. Global warming is mainly due to the\n        deforestation and pollution of environment. Due to excess in carbon dioxide there is a gradual increase in the temperature of the environment, As a result the\n        polar icecaps are melting and converting into water. This may result in floods in northern and southern hemisphere and droughts in central region. Carbon\n        dioxide can be reduced through afforestation and green house affect, There is a plantation of trees and greenery in northern countries and these are called\n        Green houses which will reduce the carbon dioxide and ultimately the heat will get decreased. There is a gradual increase in release of hydro‐carbons into the\n        atmosphere through aeroplanes and refrigirators, Hydrocarbons are the main cause for sudden increase in heat in atmosphere. Moreover, there is a big\n        damage in Ozone layerfor global warming as there is formation of holes in ozone layer which results in the UV‐light rays which are emmited from the sun are\n        directly exposed to the human skin, This results in skin diseases and skin cancers. To reduce the Global warmingwe should decrease the pollutio in\n        environment and plant trees which results in decrease of deforestaton, As the plants consume carbon dioxide and emit oxygen for their food preparation\n        which is called photosynthesis. So afforestation will ultimately leads to decrease in heat in atmosphere because of large consumption of carbon dioxide\n        through plants and trees. The carbons are mainly released from factories, vehicles, aeroplanes, jetplanes, refrigirators and other cooling applainces. when a\n        particular land is cleared or the plants and trees were burnt then the carbon dioxide in those plants is again released into atmosphere and also it leads to\n        avalanches and floods in hill areas. So Global warming is a cause of concern and it should be reduced and one should take necessary actionto reduce it in\n        atmosphere.', "\n        Today's topic is about Is global warming a cause for concern or not. In my point of view, we can concern this topic. I agree with this topic.\n        Nowadays, through out world are suffed for global warming. The main reason for global warming is increasing a vehicles on road and a using freeze in home.\n        Everyone use bicycles instead of cars and bikes, then easily reduce a global warming. Should government also, take a part to give some awareness about\n        global warming and its disadvantages. If some people are cutting trees in forests, we can lose oxygen it results increase global warming.\n        Everyone increase trees in their surrounding areas, then reduce global warming. Nature is very important for the survival of a human being on earth. Due to\n        this increasing usage of vehicles and industries, a large amount of pollutants are entering into the atmosphere and cause for global warming. Ice at south pole\n        and north pole melts, it may result in increasing of sea level, there by causing tsunami. Rapid usage of vehicles emits chlorofluoro carbons which causes acid\n        rains. Therefore, each and everyone should take responible to decrease global warming and take it challenge. Every day clean your surroundings and do not\n        drop wastage on roads. This may cause increase global warming. Moreover, reduce usage of vehicles on roads and do not cut the trees in your surroundings.\n        Finally, global warming is our responsible to take some safty measures for decreasing it. If you can reduce these green house gases and incresasing of plant", '\n        In my opinion global warming cause a pollution. Nowadays technology increases, so vehicle on the road increases like cars, buses, bikes, etc. Those vehicles\n        produce like sound pollution by horn, air pollution by releasing smoke. Mostly on the earth increases vehicle, so automatically produce pollution. The first\n        thing is to improving the trees on the earth, it is better solution to to decreases the pollution on the earth. Global warming causes like melt the polar ice caps,\n        which increases water in the ocean. The main thing is to reduce the pollution on the earth, so immediately stop the new vehicles producing companies. This\n        resultant increases the pollution the earth. Improving growing of tress, rain fall increases so water is sufficient to peoples use. The main point is here, to stop\n        the old vehicles on the road, because they releasing very high amount of smoke. Mostly of old trains also releasing high amount of smoke and other gases.\n        Increases the new technology, like use current train, they produce less smoke. The reason population increases on the earth. The newly married peoples give\n        birth to one or two peoples, this helps to decreases population on the earth.', "\n        Today's topic is about global warming. The global warming is the major issue all over the world. The main cause of the global warming is due to increase in\n        carbon‐dioxide level on earth. The global warming causes the earth very hot. The global warming is due to deforestation. The humans cutting tress and\n        building homes, for their living purpose. The human development causes a lot changes in their living habits. The factory pollution is other major cause for\n        global warming. The factors releasing lot of pollution into the environment. This causes the earth surface very hot. Natural disaster is the other cause for\n        global warming. The earthquakes, volcanic lava produces a lot of carbon‐dioxide into the atmosphere. Global warming is also caused due to air conditioners,\n        refrigerators they producing a lot of carbon‐dioxide into the earth surface. Global warming increasing the water levels of oceans and sea's. The atmosphere on\n        the earth gradually increasing. The climatic conditions on the earth may changes. The earth surface become very hot on coming 20 years. In summer heavy\n        rains occurs. In rainy season the weather is very hot. The climatic season may changes. In order to decrease the global warming growing trees, decrease the\n        use of fossil fuels. The fossil fuels is the other major cause for global warming. Burning the fossil fuels releases a lot of carbon‐dioxide into the atmosphere.\n        The global warming is reduced by taking proper measures while using fossil fuels and everyone should plant trees. The number of trees increase the level\n        carbon‐dioxide decreases their by that the water levels decreases. The climatic seasons comes according to their seasons.", "\n        Today our topic is global warming. Nowadays global warming is the major issue. The causes of global warming is mainly industries and automobiles. The\n        gases released from the industries consists of carbon components and other minor elements are the main reason for global warming. It concerns the major\n        problem all over the world. All countries are keep an eye to reduce the global warming. Some governments take severe action on the companies which are\n        not followed the rules. Industries are releasing the carbon components irrespective of rules and regulations. The remedies to control the pollution and global\n        warming are to reduce the usage of the vehicles and seal the industries those run without license.The usage of automobiles is low, Then the emission of\n        carbon components is becoming low. Therefore, the global warming should be reduced. Plantation is also reduces the global warming. The water vapour\n        present tn the atmosphere is also the reason for global warming. Due to global warming the temperature of the earth's surface is increases, Then the polar\n        icecaps will melting slowly and the sea water surface is also increases. Therefore the island's which are present in the oceans will be sub merged in the ocean.\n        so, we reduce the", "\n        One of the most problems facing the world today is global warming. Many problems could result from global warming. One of the biggest problems is rising\n        sea level. There are several things we can to do solve the problem of problem of global warming. One solution is to stop producing carbon dioxide. We can\n        do this by switching from oil,gas and coal to renewable energy. Trees observe carbon dioxide and produces oxygen, which is not a greenhouse gas. Global\n        warming could result in the flooding of low lying coastal areas. Many scientists believe that our production of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases is\n        having a heating effect on the atmosphere, and this could be very dangerous for human life. Some countries might even disappear completely.Global\n        warming will also cause the weather patterns. Many areas of the world are experiencing increased hurricanes, floods, and other unusual weather. Fish\n        population could be affected, while some insects which spread disease might become more common. If the earth's temperature becomes hotter the sea level\n        will also become higher. This is partly because water expands when it gets warmer. The pollution also will effect to the global warming. In these days many\n        people are using motor vehicles by this it effect to the global warming. This lead to pollution and it will be effected to the world. The global warming may\n        cause to the sea level. The sea level rise may cause coastal areas to flood. Deserts will probably increase in size. People on governmental and non\n        governmental panel on climate change have talked about global warming. They do no what do about it. Some things that could reduce warming are to burn\n        less fossil fuels, adapt to any temperature changes, or try to change the earth to reduce global warming. These changes effects will not be the same\n        everywhere. So reduce in using motor cycles may lead to reduce global warming..", '\n        Now a days the major issue all over world is global worming. Earth surface becomes not day by day rising the sea level.Many researchers believe that\n        excessive emissions of dioxide, as well as other green house gases. That warming impact of environment and that is very harmful to human existence. Global\n        warming might changes the weather pattern. Many areas of the earth are experiencing several weather conditions. In that conditions are drought, Floods,\n        other uncommon weather condition. The global warming causes by human activities.\n        global warming causes several health effects in human beings. Many factories release their waste in cannons, revers, etc. The major problem is deforest the\n        trees so, oxygen levels are reduced. We can prevent the global warming to planted the trees. Many people pollute the earth using vehicles so, the people\n        move shorter distance using bicycles is the best choice. Plants absorbs the carbon dioxide emitted from all the electronic goods and in return they will release\n        the oxygen which is very helpful to our environment. One more important issue is electricity. we can avoid huge changes in the future. Scientist, government,\n        and individuals must work together to overcome this thread. So we must reduce the huge electronic goods in order to save the earth. In every human take the\n        responsibility to reduce the global warming.', '\n        Global warming is a caused due to the temperature of the earth increases. The temperature of the earth is increasing due to the gases released from the\n        factories, industries. The green house gases are one of the gases which is responsible for the global warming. The humans are using the polythene covers very\n        high nowadays. The polythene covers can not degrade in the soil very easily. They take thousands of years to degrade in the soil. The people are cutting the\n        forests nowadays. The number of forests in the world is decreasing day by day. The forests are cutting by the people so, deforestation is coming in the world.\n        The people takes in oxygen and leaves out carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide is taken by the trees, due to the decrease of trees in the nature carbon dioxide\n        remains constantly in the air for huge amount of time. The global warming is increasing day by day due to this the ozone layer effected very much. The ozone\n        layer effects results in the ultra violent rays are directly falling in to the earth. The people are suffering with the skin diseases, cancers. The global warming\n        results the people are suffering with many diseases like breathing problems, skin diseases etc.The global warming is increasing by the dangerous gases from\n        the factories. The gases coming from the factories are very dangerous. This dangerous gases are the reasons for the global warming. This gases are dangerous\n        for the people who are near to that factories and industries. The water along with the harmful gases coming from the factories are sending them in to the\n        ponds, rivers, oceans etc. The water from the factories mixing with the water in the river, pond, ocean leads to collapse the life of the fishes etc. The ocean\n        water vapors in a gaseous state and mix with the atmosphere. The water in the gaseous state coming from the water mixed with the water of factories are\n        harmful. They leads to the global warming.', '\n        The depletion of ozone layer is due to the global warming. The global warming is due to the some gases released by the fridges, air conditioners, and many\n        types of cooling agents. This gases are going into the atmosphere and effecting the air over there, the air surrounded by this gases are mixing with it and\n        becoming a huge amount if thick gases in air since it is light in weight they goes up into the air. All above the air there is ozone layer which act like a shield to\n        earth that will oppose the thick gases to flow through it. The ozone will gets reacted with this gases and starts depleting, this makes the ozone to become as\n        oxygen this will make them to start depleting into space. This makes the solar rays to fall directly into the earth, which will be the cause of global warming.\n        The gets heated up due to global warming. Consequences of green house effect gases is called global warming.\n        In the olden days the usage of this fridges, air conditioners are very less so there so no global warming but where as now there are many devices which are\n        releasing green house gases. These green house gases traps and absorbs atmospheric heat and ultimately cause global warming. The vast usage of this\n        devices are causing the global warming, because of this process the earth surface gets heated.\n        In order to decrease the usage of this devices we have to use the Eco Friendly devices. This devices makes them to not to release them out but to store in\n        some storage containers. Every human should be take very seriously on global warming, if we continue to do like this our future the climate will effect in all\n        the ways like climatic changes and no water will present on earth due to heat they will evaporate.', '\n        Global warming, now a days we humans facing many problems due to this global warming. There are may causes or ways that affect our daily life. Firstly lets\n        discuss about the most common thing pollution, it cause a large damage to environment as well as to all living beings.\n        As we all known that now a days every having their own transportation. Due to this the environment is polluted , all the motor vehicles releases the fossil\n        gases that which harm for our environment and also leads to cause health problems for us. Development of cities into metropolitan cities and also increase in\n        the population also should be considered. Due to development of cities there by there is a rapid growth in Industries and factories also. These industries\n        releases harmful gases that are polluting the environment, as the ozone layer is getting melted due to these pollution. It not only effects the human beings\n        but also the every living being. Due to this air pollution we are exposed to different type of health diseases, it definitely harms our future generations. Global\n        warming is to be considered seriously and particular precautions to be take to reduce it and to lead a healthy life. There should be a decrease in the usage of\n        Motor vehicles like bikes,cars because they cause damage mostly to environment in the form of air pollution. Due to this global warming there is a increase in\n        the temperature which could leads to change in the human life. As because of this air pollution ozone layer has been melting day by day, which do a large\n        damage. Ozone layer is protecting us from the hard UV rays that are emitted from sun, if its get melted it leads to more skin diseases and also diseases like\n        cancer are also caused. To reduced all these problems and also to make our environment healthy we should follow all the precautions and also be eco‐\n        friendly.', '\n        Yes global warming is cause for concern. Because, global warming is one of the problem we are facing nowadays that is why we concern the global warming.\n        Global warming harms all nature it causes to different problems which are acid rains increasin pollution in air so, people concern this problem. Solution for\n        this problem is planting and we should increase the trees in our enviornment to resolve this problem. Causes for this problem is cutting trees in forests and\n        low level of oxyzen in enviornment by this reasons globe getting more heat. It leads to acid rains inaddition to ozone layer depletion So, we should take care\n        of our enviornment by planting and reduce of cutting trees. We are facing ozone layer depletion problem by this global warming it leads to more heating of\n        globe ann more water evapouration on earth etc. This all the problems we are facing by the global warming So, people should reduce pollution in water and\n        air and they should concentrate more on planting by doing all these things we can reduce global warming problem on earth. We should ban the all factories\n        which are releasing the harmful pollution in air and water and chemicals in enviornment. People to need overcome this problem.', '\n        "GLOBAL WARMING"\n        Global warming gradually heating the earths atmosphere. Green house effect is the first cause of global warming. The gases which are having green house\n        effect are called green house gases. The green house gases are water vapour, carbon dioxide and methane. Nowadays global warming can be seen in many\n        areas of the world. Global warming effects human beings in many ways. Global warming impact on physical health. It is already effecting the human kind,\n        plant and animals in many ways due to changed whether patterns. The atmosphere on the earth surface absorbs the gases from the solar radiation and\n        reflects to surface of earth. Pollution is one of the main cause for global warming. Pollution is caused due the usage of vehicles with smoke. In my point of\n        view every individual in the society can do many things to reduce global warming. First we have to reduce the green house gases and pollution which mainly\n        effects humans health. Usage of electrical appliances is also the main cause of global warming. If we plant some trees in our surroundings that trees will\n        absorb the carbon dioxide in the surface of earth and releases oxygen. We should not waste clean water, because clean water is very less in earth surface.\n        Avoid usage of lights on day time to save electricity. The sun provides light on day time. The usage of hot water must be reduced to decrease the global\n        warming. We have to try to grow our own foods beacuse', "\n        Global warming is presently a hot topic across the world. The globe is becoming warm because of some reasons and for this reason, it is named as global\n        warming. There are many factors that are responsible for the cause of global warming. Increase in the level of carbon dioxide in environment is one of the\n        major cause for global warming. Technology is increasing day by day, which in turn increasing the need of energy. As, energy consumption is increasing, the\n        production of energy is also increasing. In most of all the countries the primary source for the production of energy is coal. Combustion of coal is leading to\n        the emissions of large amount of carbon dioxide. The sun radiations will reach the earth and most of them get reflected by theearth's surface. If the\n        carbondioxide content is more in the environment, then the amount of radiation absorbrd by is more. This increases the tempereture of the globe. There are\n        many glaciers and icecaps across the globe and because of the increased temperature there are getting melted. This is raising the level of water bodies. If this\n        scenario continues, thenall the earth surface will be drowned in the water. This is the effect of global warming. If neglected, this will change the fate of the\n        entire world. For this reason, alot of reasearch is going on all over the world ti decrease the consumption of energy and there by decreasing the amount of\n        carbondioxide in the environment. There are many methods implemented for the decreasing of carbondioxide level. Carbon fixation is one of the method ,in\n        which huge research isgoing on. Green commmunication is also another method for decreasing the energy consumption in the field of tele communications.\n        It is dealing with energy efficiency, power and spectral efficiency. In this way global warming is a cause for concern.", '\n        Global warming is the most harmful effect from the past years on our planet Earth. Due to the changes in the human habits the Earth has gone through a lots\n        of damage and destruction on the planet. the global warming causing the damage to the human health. In the recent past few years every country taking\n        sufficient measures for protecting there environment in their country. Due to the global warming the ice caps in the polar region get melted and due to that\n        reason the sea level of the ocean gets increasing day by day. This is the main reason for the the troposphere get decreased and causing low land for the\n        human beings and animals life. This is the main cause for the killing of the life under the water by increasing the temperature of the water.\n        The main cause for the global warming is pollution created by the people for their lively hood. The carbon dioxide in the environment is increasing day by\n        day. Which creating a layer above surface of land which is not allowing the temperature to go out of the surface. Which causes the temperature to increase on\n        earth surface. Th', "\n        Gobal warming is a cause for concern because, it is related to our earth where we are living, breathing and making our life possible. I try to give a breif\n        account on this global warming as it is a very serious issuse which should be taken care off. The increase of temperature on the earth is termed as global\n        warming and this increase in temperature is due to the rise in the level of carbon dioxide. The main reasons for global warming are chloro floro carbons,\n        carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, etc. Present temperature on the earth is thirty degrees and sometimes it is crossing forty five dergees during summer.\n        The effects of global warming are mainly concentrated at the poles of the earth as they are completely in ice. Everyone is well aware that increase in\n        temperature will melt the ice at poles. One ice berg will give crores of liters of water on melting. Hence water level may increase on the earth, which results in\n        the increase of sea level. This situation may have adverse effect on earth. Sea water will submerge all the lands of earth which may cause death to many living\n        things on the earth. This major reason proves that global warming is a cause for concern.\n        The second major reason is, increase of temperature on earth directly effects humans and many other living beings on earth, as all these living beings can\n        make their life possible only under certain temperature range. Exceeding this range may results in vanishing of life on earth.Hence global warming is to be\n        considered as a serious issuse and should be taken care off. People should avoid polluting the nature and should increase greeness by planting more plants\n        and trees. Air conditioners are main reason for chloro floro carbons. Therefore, their usage should be limlited. It is everyone's responsibility to save our earth\n        from global warming.", '\n        Today my topic is about "Is global warming a cause for concern?". Global warming refers to the change in temperature everyday and lot of harmful gases\n        releasing in to the atmosphere. Global warming is the term to describe a gradual increase in the average temperature of the Earth\'s atmosphere and its\n        oceans, a change that is believed to be permanently changing the Earth\'s climate. Some of the harmful gases which are evolving in the environment are\n        methane, chlorofluorcarbons, carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide. These are gases are harmful to our body and we cannot survive for a longer period of time.\n        Nowadays so many animals as well as human beings are suffering from lot of respiratory system problems. In many areas, lot of trees are cutting down in the\n        forests as well as in the living areas. People should take care of their surroundings and plant some trees, so that plants can provide lot of oxygen for human\n        beings. Global warming is already significant and harmful effecton our environment on our communities, our health and our climate. Most of the industries\n        also exhibting so many harmful gases and due to the intake of that gases people are sentenced to death. So, there should be a certain limit of gases should\n        be evolved out of industries, so that people will not suffer from lung diseases and respiratory problems.\n        Global warming is mainly causing by deforestation and burning fossil fuels in the environment. By deforesting the forests the carbon dioxide in the air\n        increases. Mainly the plants release oxygen which is very essential for human beings to survive. We know for a fact that a program of energy efficiencycould\n        save twice as much as nuclear power at just a fraction of the cost, and what\'s morewe can start energy efficiency immediately. We have to protect our\n        environment and make it clean all the time. People should plant more and more trees for the good sake of environment and it will be useful for mankind.', "\n        Today's topic is global warming? In my point of view global warming is nothing but earth temperature is increased. Mainly global warming gasses are carbon\n        dioxide and carbon monoxide.The gasses are increased in earth temperature these gasses are released in nuclear power plant and air conditioners etc.\n        nowadays peoples heavily used in plastic covers these covers are not dissolved in earth so the earth temperature will increased.These mainly effected on\n        human beings and suffering from skin diseases. these also effected on ice bergs and plants and so many things carbon dioxide gas is one of the most\n        dangerous gas in earth. These gasses are effected on water,earth,trees,air.so government should take a action on global warming and to develop the rules\n        and regulations to decreased the gasses in atmosphere and so many act are implemented. Mainly these gasses to form a fog. These one way technology is\n        increased", '\n        The essay is about whether global warming is boon or bane. All of we know that global warming is increasing day to day and environment has a great change\n        due to many environmental hazards. Environment plays a vital role in global warming. Due to pollution, the environment has a drastic change and it is very\n        difficult to avoid that danger.In past days there are no chloro fluoro carbons but present days it is very clear that every one using chloro fluoro carbons in their\n        houses. It is a big concern to human and animal health. Because, every one face the danger due to global warming. Moreover, the acid rains are the result for\n        warming.In forests, many medicinal plants and many trees are living since long years ago. The man used to cut the big trees for transportation and sheltering.\n        Now a days every one were cutting the trees and using for their personal needs. The business magnets used to level the land and building apartments for\n        their personal profit. Mainly, the problem is cutting the trees and leveling the land to various apartments. Due to this, the environment creates ecological\n        imbalance. The imbalance in the atmosphere creates many problems to living organisms and non living organisms. Every one is responsible to the global\n        warming.In stratosphere many gases were absent. In lithosphere the ozone layer is affecting due to global warming and ecological imbalance. In my point of\n        view, it is necessary to take preventive steps to avoid the global warming by implementing different methods. Every one has to plant the trees and has to\n        protect the trees from different hazards. Climatic conditions also a drastic change in the environment due to global warming. Therefore, government has to\n        take preventive measures to protect our environment with a positve role in ecological balance.', '\n        Well my topic is about global warming. Already we know that the temperature is increasing day by day this all because global warming. With increase of\n        temperature there are many causes for the atmosphere. Due to this effect atmosphere is becoming so worsen. And also excess use of petrol leads to global\n        warming because so much carbon dioxide is releasing into the atmosphere causing polluting the surroundings of the earth. Radiation also increasing the\n        temperature. The industries are polluting the atmosphere very much . The ozone ayer is damaging very badly due to global warming. Ozone layer is very\n        important to the atmosphere because it protects humans from radiating rays which are coming directly from the sun. Radiating rays like x‐rays,gamma rays\n        and ultra violet rays are very dangerous rays which come from the sun. Without ozone layer all these rays will fall directly on to the earth. These radiating rays\n        cause many diseases like cancer, skin burns and rashes. Air pollution is also becoming worse. The diseases causing air pollution are measles,flu and chicken\n        pox. With global warming glaciers are melting which increases sea water levels. So, water calamities will occur. The motor vehicles polluting very severly. Due\n        to development of industries and cities there is a rapid increase in global warming .There should be a decrease in in the usage of motor vehicle loke bikes,', '\n        One of the biggest problems facing the world today is global warming. Many scientists our productionof carbon dioxide and other green gases is having a\n        heating effect on the atmosphere and this could be very dangerous of human life. This essay will examine the problem of global will examine the problem of\n        global warming and suggest some ways of solving the problem. Many problems could result from global warming. One of the biggest problems is rising sea\n        level. This could result in the flooding of low lying coastal areas and cities.\n        Such as egypt and bangladesh. Some countries might even disappear completly. Another problemcaused by global warming is changes in weather patterns.\n        Many areas of the world experiencing increased hurricans, floods, and other unusual weather. A third problem associated with global warming is the effect on\n        animals. Fish populations could be affected, while some insects which spread disease might become more common.\n        There are several things we can do to solve the problem of global warming. One solution is to stop producing carbon dioxide. We can this by switching from\n        oil, coal and gas to renewable energy. Another solution is to plant more trees. Trees absorb carbon dioxide and produce oxygen, which is not a green house\n        gas. If we use less electicity, we will produce less co2. In conclusion, if we makes small changes now in the way. We can avoid huge changes in the future.\n        Scientists, governments and individuals must work together to overcome this threat of global warming.', "\n        Global warming is effect of overheating of earth surface's. This is caused due to gases like carbon oxide, nitrogen oxide, carbon mono oxide. This gases are\n        lighter than air so they travel to atmosphere and form a blanket which sends back the heat signal that is reflected from earth crust's. This causes earth crust\n        to heat and melting of ice burgs and pouring extra water in to the ocean. This is causing many civilization are vanishing at shores of oceans. The world has\n        major threat from global warming. The countries at oceans shores are fearing about the wrath of the oceans on the worst case situations. Not only that many\n        islands were under immense danger of getting entirely destructed from this world. People are unaware of scenario that's can come in their way of living.\n        Governments are also neglecting the fact that their countries were in danger.They are still throwing their waste in to ocean and polluting it for worst case\n        scenario's. There were no protection for the people in the world if any wrath of nature comes by. This is a serious penalty that going to the world's\n        extermination. However, scientist are warning governments to take preventive steps . They showed the example of Japan's earthquakes, Nepal's destructions\n        in a span of few hours. So people as well governments of few countries are coming forward to stop future discrimination of the world. Scientist are warning to\n        avoid using excess of perfumes and electronic devices like air conditioner to avoid that produce excess of carbon oxides. This not only forms a blanket effect\n        but also destroy's ozone layer. So earth temperature are further raising higher. People should wake up and notice the climatic around them and put effect to\n        grow more plants around them. Plants are the only way to absorb this kind of gases. So this is everyone's care should be taken toward's nature.", '\n        Global warming shows adverse effect on our environment. As well as you know somethings about environment.

Pollution is caused by the vehicles and factories. The pollution coming out from the\n        vehicles are the mixture of carbon and these are more harmful to the ozone layer.This gases are mixed in to the air and effect the ozone. The gases in the air\n        are more and the layer has effected more. The effect of this is at the south end of the world. Due to global warming many of the birds, animals are vanishing\n        from the earth. The major effect is the sun rays are directly coming in to the earth and effect the human beings, which causes skin cancer. The gases coming\n        out from the factories are more in causing the global warming. global warming causes the eye infection, retina problems. The gases that which are coming\n        from the refrigerators and air conditioners are also the reasons of global warming. Global warming can also effect the small children who are not born. The\n        government has taken many measures to reduce the global warming and many programs to bring awareness among the the people. The government should\n        improve more rules to reduce the pollution. The industries should be reduced to control the global warming. Global warming can be reduced by planting\n        more trees and preventing deforestation. Human beings should get motivated about the effect of global warming. The government should prevent the use of\n        automobiles that which are releasing more gases.

The conclusion is u', '\n        One of the biggest problems that the world is facing is global warming. Many scientist blieve that the production of carbondioxide and green house gases\n        have high heating. Due to global warming, the temperature of the earth is increasing day by day. The rise o the temperature increases and it causes many\n        problems. If earth temparature becomes hotter the see level will also become higher. This is partly because water expands when it gets warmer. It is also partly\n        because warm temperatures make glaciers melt. The see level raise may cause costal areas to flood. Weather patterns, including where and how much rain or\n        snow there is, will change. Deserts will probably increase in size. Colder areas will warmup faster than warm areas. Strong storms may become more likely and\n        farming may not may as much food. These effects will not be the same every where. The changes for one area to another area are not well known. People in\n        government and Intergovernmental Pannel on Climate Change﴾IPCC﴿ have talked about global warming. They do not agree on what to do about it.\n        Somethings that could reduce global warming are to burn less fossil fuels, adapt to any temperature changes.

As an individual we can do many things to reduce the global warming. If we\n        reduce the usage of electricity that helps to reduce the global warming. The atmosphere absorbs the gases which are radiated from the solar radiation. The\n        usage of water should be reduced because the cleaned water is less. Green house effect is the main cause for global warming. The gases which contain green\n        house gases are called green house gases. The green house gases are water vapour, carbon dioxide and methane. Pollution is one of the main cause for\n        global warming.

It damages the living system of humans as well as animals. Raise in temperatures across the world\n        is due to the global warming. Pollution due to smoke that is evolved from factories and vehicles make our environment more polluted. Due to rise in\n        temperature, ice bergs at north pole are slowly melting down. As a result there is an enormous rise in sea level. It means oceans slowly occupy the earth with\n        it's water. So,the area which we live become a part in the ocean. After a century, our earth will fully occupied by ocean only. This is the consequence of global\n        warming.\n        Today, whole world is afraid of consequences of global warming.

The major problem in nowadays is global warming. Today all over the world industries has been established, due to this\n        various harmful gases are releasing in to the earth atmosphere. The gases that have been released by the industries is also a cause of global warming. The\n        people have been uses vehicles to travel from one place to other place. By the use of vehicles and also the combustion of fuel in the engine, that releases the\n        poisonous gases in to the air. Green house effect is also one of the cause of the global warming. In this process we release chemicals in to the atmosphere\n        through various ways . In this process the gases reaches the ozone layer and the gases effects. In the process of diffusion of the ozone layer the rays from will\n        sun directly falls on the human. This ray effects the humans in many ways. One of them is they will be effected with the diseases like skin cancer, loss of sight,\n        retina problems etc.The global warming makes the temperature increases, due to this their will be huge change in the climate and also the layers of the\n        oceans becomes warmth. This leads to death of animals and birds. The carbon monoxide gases that have been released has been effecting the earths\n        atmosphere rather than the other gases that have been releasing. The people are more interested in deforestation but they does not have interest in growing\n        the trees and plants. The trees has been making cut down by the people, due to this the global warming has been increasing. The increase of the trees on the\n        earth will decrease the growth of the global warming.

There by it will helps us to increase our life span\n        in present and future life.', '\n        Yes,global warming is the main concern for warming of earth. Global warming is nothing but high heat of earth that is over heating of earth mainly due to\n        human activities. There are so many reasons for global warming like cutting of trees, releasing harmful gases into environment, over using of carbon materials\n        and decreasing of oxygen levels.If harmful gases are mixed with air then it will leads to increasing of acidity in the air if the acidity increases the moisture\n        content will decrease very quickly. If the air is get polluting then it will leads to acid rains. If the rain water mixes with polluting gases it will leads to acid\n        solutions like carbon dye oxide, mono oxides. When this rain is reach the earth it will leads to soil erosion and decreasing of food production. When soil loses\n        its fruitfulness it will loss its moisture content in the soil which leads to heating of earth. If the water content decreases the life time of plants and animals will\n        be decrease. When the global warming is increases it will leads to direct falling of sunrises on the earth, if the sunrises are directly fall on the living things it\n        will leads to skin diseases. The water will be reduce because of high heating of earth. The growth of plants will be decrease because of global warming. We\n        can reduce the global warming by maintaining the controlling methods. If we use the solar panels these panels will observe the highly warming rises. If we\n        increase the trees those will give the high amount of oxygen which will help to formation of ozone. Because of decreasing of ozone content the rises will\n        directly fall on the earth.', '\n        Now a days the main problem facing by humans is global warming.

And in the present\n        technology a lot many things around us has been changed. And new inventions has been invented to reduce the work and to limit the time taken by the\n        human beings. From that there comes the vehicles and machines that reduce the work of the humans. And they also do the work in less period of time. But\n        the usage of them leads to the damage of the environment because the pollution and the amount of gases released by them leads to many problems. And\n        the fossil fuels like petrol, diesel and kerosene and many other fuels used for the purpose of them leads to the damage of the environment. And also the the\n        smoke released by them causes a number of diseases such that we could not be able to recover from them for a long period of time. And to prevent them we\n        have to use ecology friendly things and and the usage of the covers should be decreased to prevent diseases like cancer, skin diseases and other skin\n        problems that effects the outer part of the body. And due to the increase in the global warming there will be change in temperatures rapidly and due to that\n        there will no rain fall at the unequal conditions. And it is protecting from the hard UV rays that are emitted from sun, if it gets melted leads to many problems.\n        So to reduce the problems and make the environment healthy we should follow them.', '\n        Global warming is the major threat entire the world. It is the major problem of our country global warming issues lots of problems. In these days we are using\n        vehicles, cars due to the lack of carbon dioxide releases.

Due to the pollution man can effect these day for this reason increasing the smoke, dust. In the pollution can effect\n        due to skin problems, ulcer problem. In my point of view cultivate more trees for this reason human being want oxygen. In more oxygen in our country the\n        human being may not be effect any cause. As possible as to cultivate more trees. In benefit of trees more useful for human being, In the human required more\n        oxygen today for this reason every human being to growth more trees. For this global warming effect can be reason is to increase more industries, companies\n        to pollution is release outside. In the major companies release the pollution air from outside. In the release pollution air human being effected these things. In\n        the global warming can also effect the skin disease. In nowadays trees are cut in forest for extending the roads. In the global warming can effect the due to\n        increase the vehicles, cars, bikes. In my point every one using the vehicles for this reason only pollution is increases. In we have one layers on earth due to\n        sending on rockets it effect on layers. In government should take care on this to ride their pollution companies to dumping outside. In my opinion every one\n        should main proper dustbin from their homes. Do not throw outside the roads, due to this effects human being effected from this pollution. In my point view\n        every one should growth the trees. So, many people wasted contain to throw outside.

It cause the mainly different main to use of effects in it play mainly effect global\n        warming is mainly placed in major role in different types of mainly store in places. The human effecting the global warming in it cause effect the earth. In such\n        case it has mainly places in having the earth it has places in mainly cause has it be placed. Global warming is mainly effect the people and children and it has\n        to place and it commonly place it has to store the data. In global warming it directly places falls from the earth and it cause different types one is ionosphere,\n        ozone layer and it cause the mainly to place it has to store the value of the earth. In global warming concern the earth directly it places and it has mainly to\n        cause the effect and store the valve of the place. In some times global warming effect the places and it pollute the earth it has to place to maintain the earth\n        and to store the valve. Global warming is mainly to effect and it cause the effect the air and rain by clouding will effect mainly. Global warming mainly to\n        change the weather and it could mainly follow the clouding and by coming the raining the earth. Global warming is mainly to effect on the ocean. In global\n        warming is due to effect the earth. It reduce the life time of the human because it complete effect the human, animals.', '\n        According to my view global warming leads to so much chagrin for trees and nature. Nowadays due to vehicles and freezers there is so much global warming\n        through out the world. We should reduce the pollution to save our nature in different aspects. There are some ways to reduce global warming such as\n        reducing pollution due to vehicles and some types of freezers.Saving our nature is on my hands.We should maintain our home with neat and clean. We\n        should not throw the dust on roads, we should use dustbins for it. Usage of dustbins is very useful and helpful to save our environment from different aspects.\n        We should not pollute our nature by using our vehicles and some type of freezers. We should save our nature it is very important to save , because if the\n        nature is not safe it will effect our health. We should maintain clean and neat environment. It is safe to us and our future also. First we have to reduce the\n        pollution by various gases. We have to reduce the usage of vehicles also, because due to smoke of vehicles nature is damaging in various aspects. Usage of\n        vehicles should be reduced. We have to maintain clean environment by keeping our surroundings clean by using proper dust bins. Usage of dustbins is very\n        splendid. If we damaged our environment till will leads to carnage in future. From now we should save our environment by avoiding smoke vehicles and\n        freezers. If we save our nature it will also save us by giving healthy life to us. Nowadays usage of dustbin is boot. We should maintain proper usage of\n        dustbins. The main aim is to save our environment. We should avoid polluted vehicles and freezers to save our environment. Saving our environment is on our\n        hands. Saving of nature leads to a healthy life.', '\n        Yes, global warming is a cause for concern. Mainly global warming is increased by the people. We are using the refrigirators and air conditioners everyday\n        which results in global warming. They causes chlorine as a free radical which makes ozone layer thin, which causes acid rains.\n        To reduce global warming forest area should be increased, the vehicles which releases carbon dioxide should be optimiged. Government should also take\n        measures to reduce global warming, by educating the uneducated people about global warming. If the temperature increases further the polor ice caps can\n        submerge the land.\n        There may be some natural conditions which can cause global warming. The goverment should also take actions in it. Although changes in sea level have\n        recieved much publicity, problems of water avialability are likely to be more serious and perhaps more expensive to solve. In future, warmer world will face\n        water crisis in some parts.\n        The humun health is put at risk beacuse of global warming. In recent years there hava been never reports of spread of major tropical diseases with changing\n        climate.\n        The problem of global warming can be controlled byminimiging the emmision of greenhouse gases into the environment. If global warming continues the\n        world wouldbe danger. The major effects and impacts oare there in global warming. The educated people give some instructions to the uneducated people.\n        Otherwise we are lose our nation. The government first take actions on global warming. The global warming is a cause for concern so everybody not do\n        reasons for global warming.', '\n        My topic is about the global warming is a cause for concern? Nowadays people are creating so much of pollution. Global warming means rise the temperature\n        of the earth. Many of ways rise of temperature on earth. Nowadays industrial ares developed very rapidly. Technology is very uses for us. Technology is also\n        create a lot of pollution. Pollution is create so many ways. Basic pollution are noise pollution, air pollution, water pollution. Noise pollution caused by using\n        travelling vehicles. This vehicles are creating the aa lot of air pollution as well as noise pollution. Vehicles was release the some unwanted air gases. These\n        gases are go to the air, then pollute the air. Some industries are use hug amount of the water but it release the unwanted water. These water is flow into the\n        rivers. plantation must be increased to reduce the temperature of the earth which, results in global warming. Using air conditioner and refrigerator many\n        harmful gases are releasing, these gases are also effect the global warming. Hence, we have to reduce the usage of air conditioner, vehicles, and refrigerator,\n        etc. In the industrial ares and factories plantation must be increased. The auto mobiles are pollute the atmosphere. The level of the sea is increses due to\n        global warming. Global warming is rapidly increasing because of the radiation. Mainly radiation occur due to the nuclear power plant.', "\n        Yes, global warming is a great cause for concern. It is a major environmental issue through out the world. Basically, people should have awareness on global\n        warming. The impact ratio is very high in almost all the areas. Certainly all kinds of mesures and paramenters are supposed to be taken up. The use of plastic\n        should not be encouraged very much. As it takes more time to decompose and also destroys the enviroment nature. Today's technology is very matured and\n        it is getting advanced at a stagering speed. To reduce this global wariming, one should have to take necessary actions. Otherwise it may cause a big damage\n        to our future generations. As a result of all these things ozone layer is being depleted day by day. So, it is probably our sort of responsibility to make sure that\n        it does not get depleted. People must have awareness on all the environmental issues. Volunteers are advised to come front and make such kind of awarness\n        campaigns. Therefore, governments of state and central should have to impose strict actions towards this kind of burning issues.\n        By reducing the global warming only, we can see our next generations in a safe zone. Otherwise, it would create a lot of sensation in one's body and lead\n        them to other sort of deadly diseases. Untill we take some necessary actions on behalf of the gloabal warming, it seems to be a major problem which can not\n        be controlled. So, one should be aware of using plastic and other nature hazard materials. Mainly, the pollution should be reduced. Oxygen should be\n        improved in all the way. Hence, by following these kind of actions, one can be very healtheir with out getting effected from the global warming. So, certainly\n        some sort of measurment must be taken up.", '\n        To day my topic is about the Global warming.To day major of the problem in the world is Global warming, why most important because it is a very dangerous\n        become future . Present very bad situation in earth is facing Global warming. First we know that the Global warming.Global warming is the an Earth and\n        surroundings are very heated this cause a Global warming and also it is effected on envinorment and wheather is more hot finally the almost of surroundings\n        are heat. The main causes of Global warming is effects on human beings and animals . This is main problem facing humans and animals.Yes , we have to\n        concern for this. This the major problem facing all countries which effects on ozone layer is effect and change the climate . Most of the countries awareness of\n        the global warming . Do want to live a pollution free life .Take our carbon challaenge . Human biengs increased co2 concentration in the atmosphere by about\n        thirty percent, which is an extremly significant increase, even on inter glacical time scales .It is belived that human begings are responsible for this the almost\n        perpectly correlated with increase fosssil fuel combution ,and also due other such as changes in the ratios. combutions of fossil fules for generation ,\n        transpotation and also the manu facture of cement, all result in the total world wide about 22 billion tons of carbon dioxide to the atmospher each year.\n        About a third of this concern comes from electricity and another third from all resourse the input of co2', '\n        "Global warming" this is the most considerable situation today. Why because, the whole world today is being affected by this. this global warming is all\n        because of humans and their over technological advancements. Now the earth is making danger bells to alert us i\n             ', "\n        Today's topic is global warming? Main reason is carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide gases. These gasses are mainly released in refrigerators and air\n        conditioners and also released in nuclear power plants it creates very dangerous in human health and also effected on atmosphere. Daybyday increase these\n        gases to form global warming and then humen beings are to suffer health problemes in skin problems etc.These gases are very effected to the icebergs and\n        another atmosphere gasses. Increase the earth temperature and these are the main cause of the global warming. Nowadays these gases are very increases\n        because plastic is used in highly and every home should have a refrigerators and air conditioners. It released very high amount of gases and so many\n        industries\n             "]
